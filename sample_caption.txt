hello guys it's me nikki hello some of you have followed me for years and if you've been following me for years you know that 2020 has been a ride look [Music] in these years i got to do some of the most amazing things but also shared my darkest days with you and i can tell you today is one of those dark days a couple of days ago dylan and i were part of one of my worst nightmares um we were robbed at gunpoint at our own home and even though i can't tell you too much because there's still a very ongoing um i do want to let you know that i'm okay i may not look like i'm okay right now but i'm okay having one of those worst nightmares come true is very surreal but it also puts a lot of things in perspective now more than ever you realize that family is everything and being in good health is even more important so maybe one day i'll be able to tell you everything but right now it's impossible for my mental state but also for the law because we're trying to do everything to make this right one of the silver linings in my life now here we go this is going to sound so cliche has always been makeup and that's one thing i won't let them take away from me is my love for makeup um so i bought a barbie makeup has helped me through my darkest days losing my little brother um more stuff happening in my personal life makeup has always been that one thing that i could do to clear my mind focus on some other stuff it is literally therapy to me every time i had one of those dark days i had you there to support me and you have been there for me so much i can't thank you enough for

silly to most of you but makeup has always been this escape for me it has been this way of clearing my thoughts of getting everything in place in my mind and it is what i so desperately need in this time at this moment but i'm not gonna lie it is so hard it is going to take a lot of time for dylan and myself and our family and friends to to grow from this and to keep going with life even though

and it feels good to just take a tiffany blue eyeshadow and forget about the world for a couple of hours because i'm going to take as much time as i want with these shadows and this look because it's it's signing off for a little bit i am winging out this tiffany shade because barbie we're gonna go dramatic using these p louise acid rains i'm gonna be mixing the colors blank canvas and extra spicy to come up with a baby soft pink now i'm diving into the peachy queen amethyst palette and i'm taking this color this right here and i'm going to set that pink because i need some shine [Music] now let's apply a crazy wing to take us off of this planet [Music] that should do it now let's also extend that inner corner okay and before we move on to the lower lash line i'm just going to take this urban decay heavy metal glitter liner in pyro and just lining the bottom of my brow as well as the cut crease yes for the lower lash line i'm taking the ace beauty oceanic palette and i'm taking this color and i want to focus it mainly on the outer portion of the lower lash line it's going to go all the way through but i want it the most here so we're just going in with it applying it creating a new inner corner and then really giving it a big smoke out here on that outer portion really taking it down and now i take some liquid white liner to open up that new inner corner and that's about all i'm gonna do with the shadows i know it's not too too much but i think the lashes and the overall look are really gonna pull it together so i'm gonna do some lashes and the other eye off camera and then let's find out what's for cheeks and lips according to our new best friend's outfit florals in summer are groundbreaking sweetheart sweetheart you look so good mama oh you look so good honey okay
