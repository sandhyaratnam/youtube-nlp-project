[JAZZY INTRO MUSIC] Hello, friends, and welcome to another video. Today, I'm gonna be following a cupcake soap art tutorial and attempting to make my own delicious-looking soap cupcakes! They do look good enough to eat, but you really, REALLY, should not. 
Now, as some of you may know, I am a big fan of fancy soaps and schmancy bath products, whether that entails actually using them or smelling them or just circling them like a shark watching their every move- I mean, looking at them. I like looking at them. So much so that last year, I actually tried following a YouTube soap art tutorial, to try and learn how to make my own loaf of snazzy, swirly soap. [Flashback Saf:] [Ty from off-camera:] You've been sweating. [Laughing] [Flashback Saf:] Sweating out of my eyeballs. [Voiceover Saf:] With overall mediocre results, though it certainly was fun to try. [Flashback Saf:] Ooh, there's some pattern in there! That's something. [Voiceover Saf:] And since that experiment, while conducting my normal soap-watching routine, I've encountered an entire subcategory of sexy suds that really buttered my muffin: Soaps that look like desserts. Like pies, milkshakes, donuts, cookies, and of course... cupcakes. [Liz Lemon from "30 Rock"]: I want to go to there. Voiceover Saf: Yes, that is soap, not food. I know it looks tasty as hell, but it is NOT food. [Clip from "Finding Nemo"]: Fish are friends, not food. [Voiceover Saf:] So, fueled by a deep desire to eat soap- I mean, get a hold of this stuff-- I mean, pretty~, I decided to try and follow a cupcake soap art tutorial and attempt to make my very own batch of bewitching bath treats from scratch. I don't know about you, but... I'm aroused. Now, as for what tutorial we're gonna be following: I, of course, am still a beginner, so I'm gonna need some step-by-step instructions, especially since it seems like we're dealing with some kind of soap/culinary magic here. [Ty from off-camera:] This is not our first rodeo, but it is our second [Laughing] So today we are once again gonna be turning to the "Soap Queen" herself: Anne-Marie [Clip of Anne-Marie Falola]: Hi I'm Anne-Marie from brambleberry.com and soapqueen.com. [Voiceover Saf:] Whose tutorial for hanger swirl soap we followed in our last video. And luckily for us, Anne-Marie does have a sparkling champagne soap cupcake tutorial on her channel that seems pretty close to what we're trying to achieve. [Voiceover from Anne-Marie:] Today I'm gonna show you how to make these super sparkly soap cupcakes. [Saf:] As well as all of the ingredients and tools you will need to follow it, for sale on her website. [Saf, talking to Ty:] She's basically like the Comcast of soap making. [Ty, off-camera:] What do you mean she- she puts the wires in the ground and she also owns NBC? [Saf, talking to Ty:] Yes. [Ty, off-camera:] Okay, vertical integration at it's finest [Saf, talking to Ty:] She's the soap queen. That's why they call her that. Voiceover Saf: She's got the book, the blog, the berry, and she's getting that bag. [Saf, talking to Ty:] Anne-Marie is a saucy minx. She is and she knows it. [Voiceover Saf:] So after buying all of this - no, this video is, surprisingly, not sponsored - and watching her tutorial several times, we're gonna try and tackle it today. Now, before we go any further, I just want to say that in case this video sparks your interest, and you decide you also want to follow a soap art tutorial, a quick warning: cold process soap like this is made by a chemical reaction called saponification, which occurs when you combine oils with sodium hydroxide lye. So all of this cute soap you see here is, at its core, made by combining an oil mixture with lye water. Like this is made of oils and lye, That is made of oils and lye, and, yes, that is also made of oils and lye. And, fun surprise, by itself, lye can be pretty darn dangerous. Like it can burn your skin, it can get really hot and erupt out of its container, and it can even explode if exposed to the wrong thing. So if you're gonna try something like this at home, you're gonna want to be very, VERY careful with it. They say to keep kids and pets away from it and definitely do not get it in your eyes or eat it. So on that very positive note, let's try it ! [Video Saf:] Alright, so we are here in our kitchen with all of our soap making items set up, ready to try and make some cupcakes. So Anne-Marie's tutorial has basically like three separate sections. Video Saf: She makes the base of her cupcake as like a traditional cold process soap thing. [Ty, off camera:] Loaf? [Saf:] Block, then she makes these soap frosting separately. And then also the pink embed that goes on the top. Separately. Now, one dynamic with this tutorial is that, unlike the last tutorial we tried which was kind of like a one-and-done, like a you-can-follow-the-entire-tutorial-from-start-to-finish-in-one-sitting situation, this tutorial has a little more like prep involved. So we're gonna have to tackle this cupcake over the course of two separate soaping days and, just to complicate things further, I did also decide to change some of the colors and decorative elements of the cupcake recipe just to try and personalize them a little bit. I was thinking, you know, it would be fun to turn Anne-Marie's glittery champagne cupcakes into like a bat cupcake. For kind of like a, nocturnal cupcake-of-the-night vibe. But we will explain everything I changed, and also what is happening on which soaping day as we go. So let's just jump right into it and make some poison cupcakes. [Anne-Marie:] Before getting started with our soapy cupcakes, we need to do a little bit of prep. [Voiceover Saf:] So basically what Anne-Marie does on day one is that she makes the little embeds that go on top of her cupcakes and she also makes her oil mixture and lye water for her frosting in advance and first up on the to-do list: [Anne-Marie:] We have to make that pink embed. [Video Saf:] So basically Ann Marie uses melt and pour soap for her embeds, which is essentially like the non-dangerous, soap making stuff. [Ty, off-camera:] It's a five-minute craft soap. [Saf:] Basically she takes blocks of soap that have already been through the saponification process, kinda chops them up into little bits, melts them down, puts some pigments in and then pours them into her molds to make embeds. So that's what we're gonna do. [Voiceover Saf:] Starting by slicing up four ounces of melt and pour soap base. [Video Saf:] All right. I think I just like do this, kind of? *gasps* Honestly cutting soap is the best. I don't know why it's like ruffles patterned, I think it's just for fun [Ty, off-camera:] They got ridges. [Saf:] Melt and pour soap. It's got ridges man [Voiceover Saf:] And then once we have all of that chopped up, [Video Saf:] All right. BLOOP. [Voiceover Saf:] We gotta blast it in the microwave. [Anne-Marie:] It doesn't take long to melt, so make sure you're melting on 10 to 20 second bursts. [Video Saf:] Sorry if our microwave's gross. [Ty, off-camera:] Is it gross? [Saf:] It's a little gross [Ty, off-camera:] Hello. [Saf:] 10 seconds. Here we go. ... Smells like tortillas over here. [Ty, off-camera:] It does. [Saf:] It's making me hungry. [Voiceover Saf:] And once it's all liquefied, [Video Saf:] Ooh, it's, uh, melt-y. [Voiceover Saf:] We're ready to add in our colorants and pour the mixture into our molds. [Video Saf:] Now, um, this seemed like a sort of area in which I could have some creative freedom, add some customization to our cupcakes So I really went rogue here and got completely different embeds from Anne-Marie. I just went ham on Etsy and I just did my own thing. So I got a bunch of like bat molds and like star and moon molds. I also changed the color of the embeds; instead of going for pink, I went for gray and stormy blue. [Ty, off-camera:] So basically this cupcake is gonna be like if you had a sprinkles collab [Saf:] Yes [Voiceover Saf:] So we've gotta plop our micas into our melt and pour base and really just mix them in there, stir up some trouble. [Video Saf:] Oh yeah. [Anne-Marie:] Now I'm noticing a few clumps, so just do a quick spritz of rubbing alcohol and poof! Those little mica bubbles burst. [Saf:] See, those are those bubbles that Ann-Marie was talking about. Watchaaa- [Ty, off-camera:] Four times. Four times
[Saf:] (overlapping) And they burst. Four times? 
Tyler: Four times. [Saf:] Oh, okay. Two, three, four. [Ty, off-camera:] Oof. I'm getting a contact drunk from that. [Saf:] Yeah [Ty, off-camera:] Alright, let's keep going. [Voiceover Saf:] And next, it's time to pour. [Video Saf:] Alright, are you- are you are you ready for my jelly? [Ty, off-camera:] Yes [Saf:] I don't think you are. Oh sh*t, I'm really nervous. Ohhhhhhh~ [Ty, off-camera:] Oh yeah [Saf:] Bat! Now for this step, I'm not really gonna worry about, like, sort of neatly pouring because I figure like we can always use like a little like, um, razor or exacto knife to cut off any excess in case we have some pour-over. So I'm gonna worry about filling them. That's the vibe. Ohh, see, that's what I'm saying - if they get a little overfilled, I'm just gonna live with it. F*ck. Oh my god. Okay. Never mind. That's a lot overfilled. [Ty, off-camera:] Yeah, that's a- that's a little more than usual. [Saf:] I'm trying my best [Ty, off-camera:] We're not gonna blame it on you. We're gonna blame it on the a-a-a-a-a-a-alcohol, right? [Saf:] (laughs) Sorry, I'm blackout right now. What, what's going on? All right, so I have poured my melt-and-pour soap into my embed molds. I did not do a good job - I literally just, I scarfed it. [Ty, off-camera:] (laughs) [Saf:] I'm not gonna lie, but here's to hoping they turn out okay anyway, or at least that I can fix them later. So we're gonna let these guys sit here for a while and then we'll find out in a second if they worked. I don't know. I... I might have to do this again. [Anne-Marie:] In addition to prepping the melt-and-pour ahead of time, the ingredients for the soap frosting need to be prepped ahead of time as well. [Voiceover Saf:] And basically the reason we're making our oil mixture and our lye water for our frosting now, is so we can leave them in the fridge overnight, because they need to be cold we combine them in order for them to like, make frosting peaks. [Anne-Marie:] Measure and melt out the frosting oils. [Saf:] Starting with the 3.8 ounces of cocoa butter, which sort of conveniently come in like chocolate chip form? They call them "pastilles"? [Video Saf:] Oh, that's so fun. It's like dippin dots or couscous. [Ty, off-camera:] It's got a couscous vibe to it. [Saf:] It's got couscous vibes. Followed by 3.8 ounces of shea butter. [Video Saf:] It looks like goat cheese. [Ty, off-camera:] It does. [Saf:] Or like a hunk of mozzarella. [Ty, off-camera:] Oh, yeah, hunky. [Saf:] Oooh! That's cheesy. It's kind of crazy. [Ty, off-camera:] It's dangerously cheesy. [Saf:] It's dangerously cheesy! And then finally, 3.8 ounces of olive oil and 7.6 ounces of coconut oil. So now that we have all of our oils measured out, I'm going to melt all of these together in the microwave. [Video Saf:] Say farewell to my little friend. Then give it a quick little mix. Oh yahh, now that's what I'm talking about That is smoooooth! And then stick it in the fridge for cold use tomorrow. And then we're gonna move on to the lye water for this step, which means it's time to bring out the toxins. [Ty, off-camera:] Bring 'em out, bring 'em out. [Anne-Marie:] First, suit up for safety. Gloves, long-sleeves, long pants. Kids, pets gone in the other room and, of course, the always protective goggles. [Saf:] All right. So I am going to start off by putting 6.3 ounces of distilled water into our eight cup mixing bowl, and we're using such a huge bowl for such a small amount of water because I actually have a cap for this one, so we can put it in our fridge with a cap on but... No one cares. So let's just do it. [Ty, off-camera:] Well, it's just to let everyone know that we're trying to be safe here. [Saf:] I'm just- I'm using a cap. I'm using protection. Tyler[Ty, off-camera:] Why are you so defeated? [Saf:] I don't know. No one cares about why I'm using a big bowl. I don't know. I just thought it would be better. Leave me alone. All right, that's good. That's 6.3 on the dot, baby I'm talking about distilled water, baby. And then next up we need 2.8 ounces of the big baddie. So I am going to take my lye out of its biohazard bag. [Ty, off-camera:] Its hazmat suit? [Saf:] It's just you know, it's the universal sign for DANGER, but we're doing it anyway. And after we measure it out, we're gonna add our lye into our water. Now, I'm gonna be stirring my lye in slowly with a stainless steel spoon. This will cause a chemical reaction and it's gonna get hot in "thurr". So, just, know that. But it's not gonna stay hot, because we're gonna put it in the fridge so I'm gonna cover it up and stick it next to our oil mixture, and that is gonna wrap up day one of our soap cupcake making adventure. So first up on day two is to make the proverbial stump of the cupcakes. The cake part. [Ty, off-camera:] Yeah [Saf:] If you will. [Ty, off-camera:] All about that base. [Saf:] The butt. For which we're gonna need: pigments, fragrance, oils and lye water, which we're gonna combine and pour into our special soap cupcake mold. [Anne-Marie:] Start by dispersing our colorants [Saf:] Now Anne-Marie uses white, green and blue colorants together to make like a teal cupcake, but I was thinking since we're going for sort of a nocturnal vibe with our cupcake, why not go for something a little... darker? [Ty, off-camera:] Ooh! [Saf:] So I picked up this... where is it? It's literally - oop - right in front of me. There we go. This orchid mica, which is like a deep purple pigment. So I was thinking we'll just use this. Anne-Marie: Add one tablespoon of a light-weight oil into three different mixing containers. Saf: Now, for the sake of the recipe, I figured we should just use the same amount of oil. One, two, [Ty, off-camera:] Two and three quarters. [Saf:] Three. Mwahaha. And the same amount of pigment that Anne-Marie does, but it's just all gonna be orchid mica. And then it's time to mini-mix them together. [Ty, off-camera:] Oh sh*t! That looks like a fidget spinner. [Saf:] It does! [Ty, off-camera:] Alright, I think we're good to go. [Saf:] Great! Alright, so now that my pigments are mixed in I can retire my mini mixer for the time being and move on! To our fragrances, I believe. [Anne-Marie:] I'm going to measure out my champagne and my white rose fragrance oil from brambleberry.com so that everything is ready to go [Saf:] I should put them somewhere, right? They should go somewhere. [Ty, off-camera:] Ideally, yes. [Saf:] Let's put them in here. [Anne-Marie:] This blend is 1.5 ounces of champagne fragrance oil and one ounce of white rose fragrance oil [Saf:] Alright I'm gonna start off with the champagne Ohhhhhh Mmm, that smells amazing actually. I'm not even that big of a fan of champagne, but it smells like our car air freshener we used to have! [Ty, off-camera:] Oh damn really? [Saf:] It smells like sprite. That is the best thing I've smelled all day [Ty, off-camera:] You've been smelling me all day. [Saf:] I've just been smelling Tyler all day and he smells like, uh... [Ty, off-camera:] Yeah, what do I smell like? [Saf:] You smell like a roasted ham. [Ty, off-camera:] (wheezes) [Saf:] Oh, the white rose is way anticlimactic now. Yeah, it's just got kind of like a- a soapy grandma's house smell. [Anne-Marie:] Together, it's a wonderful fragrance [Saf:] Alright. So those are my fragrance oils prepped, and now we have to move on to making the oil mixture for our bases. Alright, so for my oils, I'm gonna start off with 2.4 ounces of sweet almond oil. OH! 2.4 on the dot. On the dizzot. People don't do that anymore, do they? [Ty, off-camera:] No one ever did that. [Saf:] (wheezes) Okay. Alright, I'm gonna pretend that didn't happen. Followed by four ounces of coconut oil, four ounces of olive oil, 4.8 ounces of palm oil and then finally 0.8 ounces of shea butter. Oh, yeah, that is a crinkle-cut goat cheese slice. That's what I'm talking about, man. And with all of those melted, Oh my god! it's hot, it's hot! ...and then mixed together, our oil soup is ready. And it's time now to make the lye water for our base. It's poison part 2: Bret Michaels strikes back. So I'm gonna suit up for safety... again. Hair is up, goggles are on and gloves are on. Cats are gone, Singular cat- cat is gone. Just me, Tyler and some toxins. Let's do this. Now, unlike for our soap frosting where the oils and the lye water need to be cold when we combine them, for our cupcake base we're gonna mix them when they're at about 120 degrees Fahrenheit each. So we're gonna have to wait for our lye water to cool down. All right. Now it's at 181 degrees Fahrenheit [Ty, off-camera:] So we got a second here. [Saf:] And also microwave our oil mixture to be warmer. Yeah, let's do that. And after a few minutes, they're both at around the right temperature so they're pretty much ready to be saponified. (buzz) [Anne-Marie:] Mix the lye water and the oil. [Saf:] Alright, so now I'm gonna pour the lye water down the shaft of my stick blender, all right? [Anne-Marie:] Now pulse your stick blender while stirring [Saf:] Oh shizz I forgot how aggressive this thing was. [Anne-Marie:] Until you get to a nice light trace. [Saf:] Now whilst blending (buzz) Anne-Marie mentions this thing called "trace". Which is basically a term that refers to the thickness of your soap batter. Like once you completely combine your oils and lye water, you can stop blending pretty quickly to get a "light trace" or a soap batter that's still liquidy and pourable. Or continue to blend to get a more viscous "medium" or "thick trace". And one thing I learned the hard way last time, is if you over-blend your soap (crunchy buzzing noises) Uh-oh. You can't really "control-Z" it and make it a lighter trace again. (more crunchy buzzing noises) Oh no So we're gonna be really careful this time, and try and get a super light trace to start with. Do you think it's trace yet? Tyler: Not yet.
Saf: [overlapping] I would say- I would give it, like, a couple more bursts, because we've been burned before. It definitely looks like it's all combined. It might not be trace yet (buzzing sounds) but let's just put in our pigments now and then if it's not trace enough, we'll just mix it more later. [Ty, off-camera:] Yes. [Saf:] Right? [Anne-Marie:] Light trace is a perfect time to add fragrance and colorants. [Saf:] Alright, so now we go, pigments [Ty, off-camera:] Okay [Saf:] And once our color is fully mixed in Oo~ that's pretty, that's super pretty~ we have to put in half of our fragrance blend as well. Anne-Marie just eyeballs it so as she says, we do. Maybe that's about half? [Ty, off-camera:] One more little spritz. [Anne-Marie:] Continue to blend until medium trace or a thin pudding (buzz) [Saf:] Oh shizz, okay, we're good. I think, maybe we need to eat more pudding to become better soapers. 'cause like, one is a light pudding versus a medium pudding versus, like, a flan? Like I don't know. [Anne-Marie:] Once you're out of thin pudding trace, pour this into the mold and tap for bubbles [Saf:] Alright, I would say that this is good to pour. What do you think? [Ty, off-camera:] I think so. [Saf:] Great. Let's do it. Alright, so I have my cupcake mold. I say let's boogie. [Ty, off-camera:] Boogie central! [Saf:] I have to remember this isn't like actual baking where you're not supposed to fill it to the top- shizz. [Ty, off-camera:] Everything okay? [Saf:] Yeah, of course. I just don't know how to get the last bit out. [Ty, off-camera:] Give it a little spank? (clink, clink, clink, clink-clink) [Saf:] Smack that! as Akon says, nay demands. Smack that. Alright, so now that our mixture is in, I'm going to jiggle it a little bit to get rid of air bubbles and to like settle the soap into the mold Alright, did we shak'd it? I feel like we shak'd it. [Ty, off-camera:] You shook'd it. [Saf:] And then it's time to move on to our cupcake frosting which, surprisingly and intimidatingly, is the hard part. [Anne-Marie:] Move your soap out of the way and it's time to work on step 2; soap frosting! Okay, so for our frosting we're basically gonna be hand mixing our now solid oils, sort of like butter in a buttercream frosting, and then adding in our cold lye water and fragrance, as we continue to beat. So that we come out at the end with a smooth pipe-able frosting. All right, ready? [Ty, off-camera:] Yeah. (whirring sounds)
[Ty, off-camera:] (overlapping) Oh yeah! [Saf:] "There we go!"
[Ty, off-camera:] (overlapping) Aww yeah! [Saf:] Woooahhhh! Wooooahhhhhhh! Woahhhhh! [Anne-Marie:] This is a pretty good- I see some hard chunks and I'm just gonna break them up [Ty, off-camera:] Making some inroads in there? [Saf:] I actually am [Ty, off-camera:] You're gonna be doing this for like 5 to 7 minutes. [Saf:] Oh! perfect! [Anne-Marie:] I want everything to be nice and smooth here. (intense whisking sounds paired with Saf's despair) [Saf:] I feel like I'm trying to like ride a wild stallion. Woahhhh! Wahhhh! I'm OK. I'm OK! [Ty, off-camera:] Oh, you know what? You're kind of doing, like, the bucking bronco at a bar. [Saf:] Yeah, this is my mechanical bull. [Ty, off-camera:] (laughing) [Saf:] This is it. All right, let's let's take a look at this. I think that we might be pretty softened. We basically just need it to be soft enough so we can like fold in the lye water and then start whipping again. [Ty, off-camera:] Yeah. [Saf:] I think I'm feeling that from it. So... let's bring out the lye. Now Anne Marie basically says "if you're feeling daredevil-ish enough, you can pour the lye water in while you're hand mixing", like, with the electric mixer. But I am nervous that I'm not good at this. So I'm gonna fold the lye water in with a silicone spatula, as she says it is fair to do. It sounds... squelchy. Doesn't it? Just minimize any lye splashing. [Anne-Marie:] You never, ever, ever want to splash lye anywhere. [Ty, off-camera:] It's not an iconic duo, lye and splashing. [Saf:] No [Anne-Marie:] So it's better to be safe than sorry and just mix in very, very slowly [Saf:] The lye water is kind of like sort of pooling at the bottom a little, but I think I'm getting it. I will have a very buff hand by the end of this. One, one buff hand. Are you into that Tyler? [Ty, off-camera:] I'm gonna have to be. (laughing) [Anne-Marie:] Once your lye water is fully incorporated, turn on the blender and mix for another probably five to seven minutes. [Saf:] Alright, so all of our lye is at least in the bowl and attempted to be folded in so let's turn on our hand mixer again and just blend the crap out of this thing. [Ty, off-camera:] Alright, let's get those muscles, babe. [Saf:] Alright, let's do it I got it, I got it. Here we go, here we go. It's happening, it's happening. [Anne-Marie:] You're really looking for your icing to be able to form and sustain peaks. [Saf:] Anne's key word here is definitely "peaks." She wants peaks, the whole peak, and nothing but the peak. [Anne-Marie:] Peaks, peaks, peaks. Peaking abilities. [Saf:] Ooh, it's getting fluffy! [Ty, off-camera:] Fluffy? [Saf:] It's getting fluffy! [Ty, off-camera:] Oh, it's looking good, actually. [Saf:] I mean, I feel like this is pretty frosting-y. I think that it is sustaining peaks. So I think we could be ready to put in our fragrance oil. Shall we? [Ty, off-camera:] Yeah [Anne-Marie:] Pour the rest of the fragrance oil blend into the icing. Notice this kind of decreases the peaking ability. You're gonna have to blend some more; probably another five to seven minutes Saf: I'm trying to make sure I get it all Get every inch of this thing. Just show it no mercy. Anne-Marie: You want your mixture to be soft enough so that you can actually put it into the frosting bag, but yet it needs to also be strong enough to hold whatever frosting peaks you create. Saf: Oh yeah! Ty, that looks like a peak! What do you think about that? Tyler: I'm peaking so hard right now. What? Saf: What? Anne-Marie: This is a really kind of fine line to find. Saf: All right. I think that it can sustain peaks. Tyler: I think so too! I think it can because I feel like - take a look at this. Yeah, ignore the incredibly messy bowl. Tyler: It looks like frosting! Saf: It looks peak-y. Tyler: I think we should go for it. Saf: All right, let's do it. So now, I am going to spoon my mixture into my frosting bag and then drag my cupcake bases into the frame and we're gonna try to do this thing, man! Anne-Marie: Just gonna scoop a couple scoops into my frosting bag. Saf: My hand is literally shaking. Tyler: 'Cause you're nervous? Saf: No, because I've been hand-mixing for so long! Tyler: Oh damn. Saf: Anne-Marie must be secretly buff. Tyler: Dude. Saf: Not-so-secretly, Anne-Marie's definitely buff. Tyler: Yeah. Anne-Marie: There we go, hold firmly with one hand and then guide it to the middle of the first cupcake and just put a dollop of frosting in the middle of that cupcake. Saf: Well, it's the moment of truth, everyone. Time to frost. Tyler: Mom's spaghetti, Safi. Saf: I'm going for this one. Okay, that looks okay. Tyler: That looks incredible! Saf: That looks okay, right? Anne-Marie: Now move on to the next one. We're going for a dollop in the middle of each of our cupcakes. Saf: Alright, here we go. We're dolloping, Tyler. Tyler: Maybe give them, like, a little bit more. She kind of gives it, like, two jounces. Saf: Like a bigger dollop like this? Tyler: Yeah. Saf: Okay. Yeah, that looks better to me. Anne-Marie: Perfect. We're gonna build around these. Saf: All right. All right. All right, are they holding their form? Tyler: Dude, definitely. Saf: Cool, so what I need to do now is- Anne-Marie: Do one circle around the base of that dollop. Saf: Once again, I'm going for the same one, okay? Oh sh*t. Oh sh*t, oh sh*t, oh sh*t, oh sh*t, oh sh*t, oh sh*t, oh sh*t. Tyler: Are these good sh*ts? Saf: Okay, okay. Tyler: Good sh*ts or bad sh*ts? Saf: Tyler, I don't know. Anne-Marie: Move on and do all of the cupcakes. Saf: Ohh f*ck f*ck f*ck f*ck f*ck f*ck f*ck. Anne-Marie: This provides an excellent base to build gorgeous soap frosting peaks. Saf: Okay boys, stay frosty here. Anne-Marie: And now it's time to do our peaks. Saf: Alright, so I'm gonna go... Tyler: For all the marbles? Saf: Northwards if that makes sense. Tyler: Let's go north! Saf: I'm going to go towards the sky. F*ck, okay, I'm so nervous. Anne-Marie: Start going around your dollop of frosting. There we go. Now we're building it. Perfect. Saf: Boop! Tyler: Ohhhhhhhh! Dude. Saf: It looks like an amateur Yogurtland experiment. Tyler: Okay. Saf: But it's not a fail. Tyler: No, it's not, it's sustaining peaks! Look at that peak right there! Right? Look at that! That's like a cupcake that's discovering itself! Saf: All right. Let's try this one too. Oh f*ck, f*ck, f*ck, f*ck. Tyler: A little bit of a rogue squirt? Saf: I did start off with a rogue squirt. Tyler: That looks pretty solid, Safiya. Saf: Alright. [chuckles] Anne-Marie: I'm almost not exhaling. I'm so worried that these are gonna fall but they're doing great! Saf: The good thing is our windows are open. So it's kind of cold in here, which is supposed to help the peaks stay Tyler: Yeah Anne-Marie: Nice. Good height. Tyler: It's kind of, like, uh, a nipple. Saf: Yeah. Tyler: Yeah. It's- it's exactly like a nipple, actually Saf: It's literally a nipple. Anne-Marie: There. I love the height we're getting on this. This is just fantastic. Tyler: You know, why don't you get a little aggressive with this guy, go a little higher? Saf: Should I make this one taller, is that what you're trying to say?
Tyler: [overlapping] Yes. Tyler: Make this guy Mr. Frosty or whatever. Saf: Like that? Tyler: Yeah. Saf: Okay.
[Both laugh] That one's really tall now. Tyler: Yeah, it's the f*cking lizard king. [loud laughter] Saf: You're gonna regret the day you ever messed with me, I'm the f*ckin Lizard King! You don't even know my real name! Robert California: I will not be blackmailed by some ineffectual, privileged, effete, soft-penis'd, debutante. You don't even know my real name. Saf: That is what Anne-Marie is gonna say when she calls our house later. Robert California: I'm the f*cking Lizard King. Saf: Alright, so it would be stupid for me to try and add more frosting to any of these, right? This one looks like it could use a little bit more, but at the same time I feel like if I f*ck it up worse now, I'll be mad at myself. Tyler: Okay. Saf: So I should just not. Tyler: Put it down. Saf: Alright, I'm gonna put the frosting bag down. Tyler: Put the bag down, lady. Anne-Marie: Now, just the last final few touches. Time for glitter, cause everything is better with glitter! Saf: Now, Anne-Marie uses sort of like a-a plain white glitter, but on brambleberry.com, I found some silver holo glitter. Tyler: Damn, that's the good-good. Saf: And I figured we HAD to get it. Tyler: Hell yeah. Now it's over your sleeve. Saf: Oh now I'm just covered in holo glitter. Didn't think about that. Anne-Marie: And then finally gonna top with those really cute pink embeds from earlier. Saf: Alright, so now we have our embeds. We popped these guys out a couple of hours ago. It's going down. I'm yelling timber! Just in case we needed to redo this entire step. But thankfully, a lot of them came out pretty well, like most of the stars. [gasps in amazement]
Tyler: [overlapping, unintelligible] Saf: Oh my god, it's cute. Some of the moons. Oh wait, it-it's actually... I would even say this is hella cute. And even a couple of the bats. Tyler: Ohhh!
Saf: [overlapping] Oh my god he's so cute AND fun! Came out looking pretty good or at least medium. Oh, the back is messed up. But the front is okay! and the ones that I completely scarfed with my bad pouring job were at least salvageable with an exacto knife. Now that's what I call surgery. Tyler: They're going under the knife. Saf: What is this, The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills? Tyler: Yes! Saf: I'm not gonna apologize for that. I'm just gonna let it- let it sit. So we've got a fair amount to work with in terms of what can go on our cupcakes. So what I'm gonna do is sort of treat my frosting like clouds in the sky, with my stars and moons peeking out from behind the clouds, and the bat sort of flying in front Tyler: [gasps] That one is pulling... it... off. Saf: Yeah, I do like that. Obviously, I have no idea what I'm doing here but I'm just trying to let the muses guide my hand. Also, based on the nature of the soap cupcake, once you place an embed, you can't really move it so I just gotta be okay with wherever they end up. Tyler: It's kind of like Pringles, but, you know, the fun does stop. Right? Saf: Once you pop it the fun does stop. Yes, absolutely. Alright, so those are all of our embeds placed into our cupcakes. I'm honestly pretty pleased with them, this is my first batch of soap cupcakes and I feel like expectations were pretty low. Okay, so I'm gonna stick my cupcakes in the fridge for a couple of hours. Woo-hoo-hoo. Welcome to bootytown. What that means, I do not know. Just so the frosting really sets. I hope everything goes okay in there. [both laughing] All right. I guess we should clean up now. Tyler: Probably. Saf: Alright, so it's the next day. The cupcakes have been sitting in the fridge for a couple of hours and then out of the fridge for many more hours. And it feels like it's time to pop them out of the mold so they can cure in the air. Tyler: Pop those bottles! Saf: Yes, it's time to pop these bottles. It's time to clap these cakes. What? Time to- never mind. Tyler: Is that a butt thing? Saf: As I said it it's-- yes? I think so? Yeah. Alright, I'm going for this one. Tyler: Alright, let's do it. Anne-Marie: So the way it works; if you pull gently away from the side, you're really working to release this air lock. Saf: So basically I have to like push it up and then grab it from the base. Oh my god I think I just put my nail in it. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, it's out. Did I put my nail in it too bad? A little bit. I can just smooth it though, right? It's soap. It's fine. Tyler: It's soap! Saf: Alright! That looks pretty nice! The frosting is very asymmetric, it's umm interpretive. Modern, flowing, its like a Gaudí house. But besides that, it looks like a cupcake to me. Tyler: I mean, Saf, it looks pretty good. Saf: So let's get the rest of these out here and see how we did across the board. Oh, oh, not bad. Not bad. Not bad. That's cupcake number three "oot and aboot". Tyler: "Oot and aboot." Saf: Now there are a couple of these that are a little less lumpy. A little more straight up and down but in general I would say that they are cute, sufficiently batty, still intact but not very uniform. In fact if I had to describe my cupcakes, it would be homemade with love but not much skill. Tyler: I think you should just go the route of modern art and just go, "Everything's intentional!" Saf: Right, exactly. Tyler: It's f*cked up? Meant it. Saf: I put my nail on the side. Meant that too. That rogue squirt right there? All part of the plan. So with that in mind, I hereby present to you our finished cupcakes! Now, in order to actually use these guys as soap bars, we have to wait about four to six weeks for them to cure or for all of the water to evaporate out of them. I'm so nervous. How do I even do this? Tyler: I don't know. Saf: Oh it feels soapy. But they did last all of those weeks sitting in our kitchen, despite almost being destroyed by a rogue Sriracha bottle. And although we were able to get a nice lather going - oh, there we go. Oooh yeah, okay! Look at that! - I will say they are kind of a strange shape to wash your hands with, because I'm not exactly sure, like, how I should grasp them. And I also feel a little sad using them because I want them to stay  perfect little cupcakes, you know? So I feel like these will probably end up being more like decorative bath treats rather than functional ones. But nonetheless, I feel very accomplished having made these on my own, or at least in Anne-Marie's shadow. because it was overall pretty hard. Especially for a soap peasant like me. Thankfully now the only challenge left is to not eat them! So, I'm off to get a real cupcake before things get ugly.

A big shout out to Caitie for watching, thanks for watching Caitie, and I will see you guys a-next time. we're gonna have to go to thesaurus calm and think of a new word for smash we're gonna say it like six thousand times is this video the video where we change our outro hello friends and welcome to another video this week I'm gonna be destroying every bath bomb from lush and then reforming them into one single Franken bath bomb that's right tonight we are going where no bad science video has ever gone before the bathroom so previously on our channel I've mixed together a lot of things including a hell of a lot of lipstick an impressive amount of booty guru eyeshadow and also some non makeup items like every candle from Bath & Body Works and every possible wedding cake flavor bad makeup science has really just gone off the rails at this point so I figured while we're off-roading it might as well take a bath now some of you may know of a chain of skincare stores called lush which is famous for its handmade products it's colorful and wacky bath goods and also the signature robust smell of its stores that's strong that's a wall of fragrance it's kind of like subway but instead of smelling like Italian herbs and cheese you come out smelling like a robust vanilla tea bag and some of Russia's most popular products are their fizzing bath bombs which for the uninitiated are basically like solid balls of soap oils and fragrances which you drop into a bath to get some skincare or aromatherapy benefits and also for funsies now as an avid smeller and looker adder of fancy bath products lush is for me often a top destination when going to a mall and it was during one of these visits while flagellating my nostrils with floral aromas that the oh so familiar urge to destroy combined and birth anew struck me the time had to make a Franken lush bath bomb and to become the ruler of sense the Archduke of odors the Emperor of aromas the life of Bath Canterbury Tales anyone know just me okay also you guys have been requesting this one for a while so let's do it all right so we are here at the lush store at the Century City Mall ready to buy some bath bombs to smash to shamash if you will oh that's gonna get old fast so we quickly got to work there right here bath bombs right here filling up their little egg crates with one bomb of each variety I'm trying to like figure out in my way of determining which is the best one you know like you're supposed like knock on a watermelon or something give them a good squeeze I feel like that will destroy them do not Honka Honka the bath bombs now although the classic bath bomb is round lush does do a fair amount of variation in terms of texture what is this the belly button oh that's a navel yeah oh it does look like a navel sighs oh wow they're giant ones giant giant giant and shapes ooh like eggplants phallic and treasure chests why is the rum always gone just to keep things fresh and smooth that's the guardian of the forest the nigh guardian of the forest Wow I don't know what to say for myself I have nothing to say blush does also make a lot of bath balm adjacent items all right so we've got body conditioner body butter magic Christic crystals I do not know what that is I'm gonna leave that over here like shower bombs and bubble bars what about a bubble rune a bubble what a bubble rune was that Tyler do I look like I know but just to maintain the sanctity of our formula we're gonna go with just the traditional bath bombs yes I'm ready to ready to check out and after ransacking the store we ended up with 46 bath bombs now luscious bath bomb lineup does change rather frequently as there are many limited edition location exclusive bombs so I'm gonna say we probably missed at least a couple but we definitely got a healthy chunk oh I thought of bath bombs and with our haul in hand it was time to commence our experiment let's go home and smash him let's go home and smash him y'all let's kick the camera ting it's like a kick in the face okay so we have all of our bath bombs here and today our goal is to smash all of our bath bombs puree them in our food processor and then form them into bath bombs with our bath bomb press I like it I'm holding a weapon in my hand and very threatening here beckoning with the hammer Bob the Builder is quaking also in case you're wondering where I am we moved say hello to the new kitchen hello so we've divided our 46 bath bombs into nine different color categories so I'm gonna be smashing and pure aying by color so we can keep our color separate and then use our color categories to try and make a layered rainbow design in our bath bomb I can't make any promises but we're gonna try and make it cute and we're gonna start smashing with the pink category so our first bath bomb is called Twilight Twilight new bath Twilight breaking bath bombs mood and it just smells pretty sweet I would say it smells like what Bella's blood smelled like to Edward raging hormones all right shall we yeah should I hold it probably just don't hit your fingers oh you know what I should use this side so I'm kind of like axe picking that did nothing that did absolutely nothing okay oh oh here it goes if I dig deeper do you think I'll find Renesmee nose that lets Bella's baby whoa that's what I'm talking about oh it's really blue inside so I'm gonna just break these into like a few smaller pieces yeah there we go alright I'm figuring it out man so besides Twilight there are eight other pink bath bombs five of which are traditional spheres I'm gonna grab I think this rosy one next including a sex bomb which is apparently one of their most popular I mean lush is nothing if not horny yeah we also have magma all right I'm gonna try and like pick at the seam do you think that'll work sure whoa oh my god it actually yes marshmallow world this one's breaking good as opposed to Breaking Bad I wasn't going over there choco mint and pink just pink oh yeah that would did like a backflip blanket safety disclaimer I'm sure I'm not using a hammer correctly so just don't do anything I do ever besides those we have three oddly shaped bombs strawberries and cream oh yeah a lucky cat oh yeah there is like a gold bar inside what is that I don't know but I'm covered in cat and a peach emoji they call me the booty destroyer you don't like that no yeah absolutely no reaction from Tyler okay yeah so those were the Pink's up next are the oranges into the yellows now there are only like two and a half orange bath bombs since one of them is like orange and yellow and first up is yuzu and Coco I keep thinking it's called like my navel but I think that that's just because that's what I think every time I look at it we're any of them called my navel no but a fuzzy navel is a kind of orange drink so I thought it would like work well but it's fine it's fine I'm fine with it it's fine and then the only other full orange bath bomb is this one called Yuki hi this is totally not the vibe of this bath bomb but when I look like straight into the camera with it it's a I of Sauron no you don't think so now it's more like his bellybutton mmm the navel of Sauron mm-hmm and then to finish out the oranges we have our fruity giant bombshell it's also like tied together so I think there might be stuff inside whoa what the hell are we gonna do with a whole bunch of dehydrated orange slices I don't want to mess with our bath bombs formula too much so I'm just gonna leave these out and maybe we can make potpourri with them later or something so I'm gonna hammer the orange first and I'm gonna keep them separated so I'll like put the orange half with the orange category and the yellow half with the yellow category this is flying Soren break and free natasha bedingfield song no it's a high school musical reference Tyler is showing his age here I'm woefully ignorant of High School Musical there's not a star in heaven that it can't reach who's that it's it's still high school musical besides the Giant dude if there are three other yellow bath bombs honey I washed the kids it does have slight death star vibes but like happy death star royalty I feel like Cady heron mrs. regicide when she like divides up the crown amongst all of the Spring Fling attendees and turmeric latte whoo oh it's mustardy in there like a spicy Dijon mustard all right so that is the end of the yellows on to the greens starting with the plainness of the mall this one which is called bow bath besides that one avocado Thanks we also have four other green bath bombs including the guardian of the forest it's grouped everyone in bath bomb form and also this one Mel you've seen melly-mel using Mel usin a mucinous it's mucinex yeah Mel you see it Mel you don't we also have two fun shaped ones like a little turtle we're gonna find out if you're totally enough for the turtle club now well they've rejected me so I'm acting out and a treasure chest called the Pirates of the Caribbean for carrageenan like I've been placebo and it smells like the chlorine in like the Pirates of the Caribbean ride at Disneyland it's a little musty smelling damp room it smells damp oh ah doesn't aggressive strike that was cinematic okay chest destroyed treasure acquired greens done let's move on to blue now there are a lot of blue bath bombs nine to be exact and interestingly a lot of them have like extra ingredients incorporated into them you can see some of the seaweed in there we'll kelpy so for the dry ingredients that are like mixed into the bath bomb formula we're just gonna leave those in there and hope the food processor takes care of the rest but anything we can remove like sea salt rocks or cocoa butter polyps oh oh oh there's butter in here we're gonna do our best to get rid of so that is a full and extraction right there it's kind of like dr. pimple popper if dr. pimple popper murdered people then yes it is like that too besides those ones with like surprises inside there are also a lot of uniquely shaped bath bombs in this category like this little bottle of comb it's a small bean rocket science Miss Molly I don't know it smells like Elon Musk that's not bad I'll let that one fly Rose butterflies there's some reason I was looking at that bath bomb I just had Nelly Furtado's I'm like a bird in my head me too wait actually me I was thinking that in might I don't know why we are on the same wavelength is that the butterfly effect no and this pale blue robot you know what's up you are Lord Farquaad right now I was about to say ginger man from Shrek vibes Tyler we are vibing right now maybe what happens is that we're tripping from all of the lush powder it's lush but it's really just ayahuasca and after that it's time for the purple category starting with goddess Oh house smell it smells like the gift shop at Colonial Williamsburg does it really Konya Williamsburg really had a I love it there besides that one we also have a lumpy blackberry bath bomb and a lavender bomb shrouded in gaad's I think they're like in the bath your supposed to keep it in there because I think there is lavender in here so then it'll stay in like it's a little satchel as it dissolves but I think that for our purposes I should take it out of the bag that one smells amazing it's just straight lavender to the face but it's really good and then the last purple bath bomb is the eggplant emoji I feel like the meme that will be associated with this will be when Tyler pisses off Sofia oh my god I would never sounds like a 2000s Florida lawsuit Florida woman hammers junk surprise alien dick like I said before lush is nothing if not horny oh I almost just said farewell sweet penis but that's not good can't really say that can i you did just say it alright let's just leave it at that okay yeah so that concludes the purple category now we're on to the black bath bombs of which there are only two I'm gonna start off with the Illuminati eye this one actually used to be named Dark Arts but you know apparently JK Rowling took a break from Twitter to unleash her inner lawsuit and now it's called secret arts secret arts this other one is called black rose and it essentially looks like if our merch was a bath bomb I would say basically yeah that's fair it's pretty on brand I like it alright so those are our two black bath bombs up next is the white / beige category now there are eight neutral bath bombs and in the interest of time we're just gonna smash and then pass through them is there a song called smack that from the mid-2000s I was gonna say smack that out on the floor oh yeah all right let me do the but first presumably that's what what a conman you know smack in the butts you know but though we are trying to hack our way through this category as fast as possible as it gets later I become more ruthless please pray for my thumbs there are a few interesting dudes in here like Dragon's egg whoa it's yogi our EP gudetama another fun-filled giant bombshell oh it's like a whole ass dried rose and a second mummified bath bomb look at that debris in there that's a chunky monkey it looks like garlic butter you know when you see butter that has like extra goodies in it like hands Mary and I don't like that imagery but it smells pretty good and with those smack - all on the floor it's time to move on to our last category the multicolored bath bombs are you ready to bathe the rainbow that's all I got of which there are three this dual toned one moon spell oh whoa there's a moon in there I'm not sure like what utility you get out of that in the bath but it's pretty cool the psychedelic groovy kind of love dye lava lamp dye and our final bath bomb of them all The Love Boat where should I go the the bow or the stern also which ones which poop deck where's the poop deck Oh goodbye poop deck we're about to sink this Love Boat this boats heart will not go on that's actually not bad I didn't see that coming so with that we have crapped smacked and smashed all 46 of our bath bombs and it is time now to move on to the food processing portion of the experiment I do have two food processors here one mama and one baby just in case there's too much chunk too many chunk too many chunks one thing to note before we get started is that after smashing some of the bath bombs revealed other colors inside so weary categorized a couple of them including the entire rainbow section so we now only have eight groups to grind all right let's see if I know how to use a food processor with you starting with pink ready yeah go for it let's pound some rock which I hold the top that's a good food processor I think it's literally done it's pulverized I'm not shocked I thought I was gonna have to like go at it for a second this is awesome what else could we put in there haha now as we are puree our bath bomb powder to go into our rainbow design [Music] dude I am totally gonna break this thing there's like no question there is one dynamic of this experiment we haven't talked about too much ooh which is the odor this one smells like mint toothpaste it looks like cotton candy but it smells refreshing so as we blend our categories to a pulp oh my god oh yeah I feel like this one's Wilder we're gonna give each one a good sniff woo that one smells amazing yeah it's like orange jasmine this one's my favorite to see just what kind of sense we're working with here I'm gonna to switch this thing yeah stranger things style and what we found was that the smells were all over the place there's like smoke rising out of this way now it's like if lush got dusted by thanos with some kind of fresh scent dude citrus citrus I'm getting nothing else literally just lemon some more comforting smells this one kind of smells like a Christmas cookie I think the turmeric is turning it spicy and some herbaceous aromas hmm it kind of smells like a citrusy chamomile tea herbal tea the blue category went a little stereotypical this one smells like a oceanic Glade plugin like fake ocean smell I would say and the block bath bombs though small in number now that's what you call the black long packed a serious potpourri punch it looks like soot but it smells like dried flowers not fresh flowers dead flowers and honestly I don't even know what happened in the purple category that does not smell good that smells a really bad actor smell like it smells like a baby wipe like a diaper bag yeah I don't want to be than that I guess that's all to say that there's a lot going on here so I'm interested to see which fragrances will come out on top I'm just hoping it's not the purple the rest of them smell nice this one is just funky but with that we do have all of our color categories dusted so it's finally time to make our bath bomb we have destroyed and now we must rebuild now when most people set out to make a bath bomb they're making them from scratch like with a recipe but in our case we are trying to revive dead bath bombs which makes our process a little different specifically we're going to need to wet our powder so it will restate to itself and keep the shape of a bath bomb but also make sure that it will still fizz when we drop it in the tub so to make our formula we are going to be adding baking soda oil and citric acid to all of our individual color categories nope and the citric acid and the baking soda are gonna be what causes the bomb to react with water and the oil will hopefully be our binding agent we could also use witch hazel but because it's more watery and because we're beginners were afraid we might prematurely activate the Franken bath bomb powder while mixing now this is a little time sensitive because they can dry out and we need them all to be wet at the same time so Tyler is gonna be helping me we're gonna be doing a couple of the colors off-camera and hopefully we can figure this out technically our powder should be fizzy without this stuff like there is already citric acid and baking soda in there but since we're adding more oil into our mixture we wanted to make sure the ratios were right and once we have all eight colors prepped it looks pretty good yeah I think it's ready to go go for it we can bust out the real star of the show so this is our bath bomb making machine it is an industrial bath bomb press that we bought on a whim and now we're using it which I'm very excited about there are other bath bomb making methods notably molds but we thought this machine seen more exciting and the way it works is that it has a little cup or mold that you fill up with your bath bomb batter we're gonna be putting alternating spoonfuls of each of our colors in like in rainbow order to try and make a striped pattern I think that seems pretty good actually it's nice and perfect once it's full you place your cup underneath the pressing arm of the device and then the machine is gonna use air pressure to like pretty aggressively compact your formula into a bath bomb oh this is the coolest thing ever then you twist and flip the mold and push the bath bomb into your hand oh no no which for our zombie bath bombs was easier said than done it's beautiful but sad here is bath bomb attempt number one it is cool as hell but it did not work we're trying it again we're not giving up we had a pretty hard time trying to figure out how to make this machine work for us Oh sadness which kind of makes sense because it's an industrial press and I would hardly say we are in the bath bomb industry oh yeah we how did that happen in fact if anything I would say we are actively undermining the bath bomb industry Wow but regardless we just could not get our bath bombs to stop splitting in half down the middle mm-hmm it's stuck in there and it's full unstuck up there whether they made it out of the press or not no so after trying a few different troubleshooting methods like greasing up freakin everything the press and the batter shaking our formula as we spooned it in shake it good shake it and desperately holding the mold together as the pressing arm lifted high everyone hold on to their butts again we still failed oh it might have just fallen into my hand as you can see this side is a bit soft and like kind of crumbled but the other side Oh literally as I said but the other side is good it imploded in my hands so we finally decided to as a kind of Hail Mary change up the order of the colors going into the mold don't try inverse rainbow let's try inverse rainbow just because Roy GB that didn't really seem to be working for us it looks like broccoli let's do this is the broccoli Avenger okay all right here we go shake it like a Polaroid picture okay okay okay I see it I see it already central no one say anything don't breathe okay wait it's still in my hand how do i how do I get out of your hand and hold on okay okay oh my god that's a Frankie bath bomb ah someone pinched me so I guess the inverse rainbow thing was the best idea we had all night I thought you were gonna dwight schroot it and that it was gonna make the watermelon the bath ball may look a little green but don't worry there are a lot of the other colors in there they're just hiding inside that is a sexy-ass bath bomb can I make out with a bath bomb so with one multi-layered Franken bath bomb produced this is rock and roll man those are appropriate rock horns this is rock and roll we took a few more whacks at it to make a backup bath bomb just in case don't ask why it's so wet I did some things I'm not proud of and then just as kind of like a secondary test we decided to use the remains of our earlier failed attempts to make another Franken bath bomb it's gonna be the phoenix bath bomb from the fallen attempts it shall rise I call it the Franken swamp bomb it's beautiful it's perfect that was like the eighth baby for Octomom it just kind of walked out just ran out of the womb and after quickly making a back up swampy we were pretty much ready to retire the machine all right so we have two bath bombs of each variety and so basically all we have to do is wait a couple of days for them to dry out and then we can all take a bath together it's very it's a very Roman video you know yeah that's the vibe hello friends and welcome to my tub we are here a few days after forming our Frank and bath bombs two bigs the backbones do seem like decently dried out I'm nervous to touch them I'm nervous to look at them so it's time to bomb this bath all right bring in the bath bomb oh I got it all right I'm gonna sniff it a good sign is that it doesn't overwhelmingly smell like lavender but it's hard to identify like exactly what I'm smelling it's definitely like a sweet smell would it be a cop-out to say it just smells like the lush store who would that be a cop-out after doing some serious investigative sniffing I think the dry Franken bath balm smells most like a combo of rocket science and rose butterfly which have Sicilian lemon bergamot and rose oil in Bama so it basically smells like Elon Musk with a hint of nelly furtado but let's see how that holds up in the bath shall I cannonball or like gently lower Oh cannonball okay ready good bye oh it's fizzing oh it is a purple and green bomb oh it's split in half oh there's one half where's the other half right here oh what a great emergence so as for first impressions it is very fizzy which is great and what's also fun about it is that as the bath bomb dissolves you can see the different color categories come to the surface oh no here I got some yellow it's like a sorting hat bath bomb yes yellow orange I'm seeing some blue as well so we did get some bath utility out of our rainbow design Oh oh yeah look at that emergence hi sis ah we're gonna bottle this and sell it for $20 in the Internet right right Yeah right bad makeup science bathwater do I have to like pour it down my butt crack for it to be worth something on that market yes now with our bath bomb fully disintegrated we were able to get a better look at just what it had done to the tub so this is a shredder bath bomb he's got layers to right it's got layers it ends up green and swampy ah it doesn't smell like onions thankfully but it does look the part now as for what it actually smells like Oh interesting yeah as I'm smelling my Franken bathwater $20 on top of I it smells way different than like the actual bath bomb did before we dropped it in oh yeah it smells much more florally whereas the dry bath bomb was dominated by more of a sweet citrus scent but both floral and orange sense make sense when you look at the most common ingredients across all of our bath bombs as lavender rose Alang Alang jasmine and chamomile are all in the top 10 along with lemon orange and bergamot there's also a lot of cocoa butter even when you consider the lumps we removed though that doesn't really have a strong scent but when you team it up with all of the almond oil we use to rebuild the bombs it definitely makes it very moisturizing and slick in here let me oh oh oh I'm sorry Oh farewell farewell cruel world besides moisturizing the top ingredients also have soothing relaxing cleansing and energizing properties so it's basically like a soapy Four Loko it's an upper and a downer you know I'm facing towards $20 for her freaking bath bought bath water so you better pay up if you're gonna drink up Tyler also wanted to lend his nostrils to the cause right this is making me uncomfortable and we're married and though he tried his best it does smell like wash he brought few insights if any but not to close the door on any future odor investigations we did actually save one mason jars worth of Franken girl bath water ooh YUM not to sell just to have now we did also want to do a really quick bath test with the Franken swamp balm and though it obviously doesn't look the same oh yeah it looks like when Sponge Bob had the suds it did bring our bathwater to that familiar Shrek ehue I feel like mine is more clumpy and I feel like there's more like a general multicolored nough stew it but it is certainly converging to swamp water green and emit a mild lemony flower aroma there you go Tyler Williams chest hair bathwater these thighs don't lie how its hips don't lie and with Tyler and his chest hair thoroughly enjoying their bath I can just rotate like this almost like like one of those pigs sits on a thing like a pig on a spit relax it seemed that our first episode of bath makeup science had come to an end I feel overall that was a pretty successful bath bomb experience I really enjoyed the sheer amount of Smashing and smelling I got to do in this experiment I feel you're gonna snot rocket later sawfish to be multicolored that would be fun and it was also a very gratifying francon experience because we were able to figure out how to make all of this into a bath bomb which ended up being not bad and I was really happy with both the design and the fizziness of our final product that said I wouldn't say it was the world's greatest or most luxurious bath bomb like I'm not feeling like the effects and niceness of all of the bath bombs from lush together it is less than the sum of its parts if that makes sense but it's not the worst it's not too chunky and it doesn't smell like butt so I feel like that's good so in conclusion I had fun I would make bath bombs again though probably not from the ashes of 46 other bath bombs and I am not sure what we're gonna do with our mason jars full of bath water but my money's on family heirloom probably well we had our freaking candle at our wedding maybe on our 10-year we'll have our Franken bathwater gross but romantic thank you guys so much for

So a few weeks ago, I was trawling the internet bottom-feeding like a carpet shark as I am want to do, and I stumbled upon a few articles announcing the launch of Amazon's new personal shopping service where basically Amazon Prime members can pay a small fee each month to take a fashion quiz and be matched up with a real live stylist as opposed to a robot stylist, I felt like that needed to be said, who will pick out things for you to wear. Now when I think of personal shoppers, I sort of think of old-school, higher-end department stores. Kind of like what Rachel from FRIENDS's job was at Bloomingdale's. "My mom calls it bloomies." So I think it's kind of interesting that Amazon has "killed retail" and now is trying to bring back things from it, but it also feels like with this they're trying to close in on the Stitch Fix style box space because the format is kind of similar where you take a quiz, they give you suggestions, you try things on, and choose what to keep. So it seems like Amazon is just trying to eat everyone's lunch. "Who would steal 30 bag lunches?" But I guess we'll see how they do both in terms of figuring out my style and in terms of what the products themselves are like because Amazon has sort of a huge spectrum of quality and price. Like will we be on the Wish side of Amazon or on like the Nordstrom side of Amazon? I guess we'll find out. So right now I'm gonna take this quiz, and then in a few days they'll give me a personal shopper, and then we'll see what they come up with. And if I don't end up bald and wearing a great vest I'm gonna be very upset. Alright, let's do it. So apparently the Amazon personal shopping service is only available on the app for your phone, so I have my phone. I am screen recording that is why there is a computer here also. I think I should just search for personal shopper right? Here we go I found the landing page. "Introducing personal shopper by Prime Wardrobe. Let our stylists do the shopping for you. Just $4.99 a month. Cancel anytime. We'll see about that Amazon." You can't really cancel anyone nowadays. All right, I'm gonna click "let's get started". Bing! Ooh, it says: "create your style profile", "customize your upcoming styling", and "sign up for your membership". Am I not already signed up for Amazon Prime? Is this like sign up inception? I have to sign up for an account within my own account. All right, I'm gonna click "next". Ah yes, we're on to the quiz now, and the first question of my style profile is: "How often do you like to wear the following styles?" So it seems like it's giving me sort of like outfit flat lays, and then I have to say if I like them or not or how much I would wear them. And the first one is casual. I would say often. I would say that I don't really wear real pants anymore, so I think that counts towards often. - [Tyler] I would say always. Edgy! Oh, I mean I think this flat lay is definitely like more my vibe, but I would say my daily style is more like edgy with yoga pants on. I'm gonna say often on this one also. Next up, romantic. I do like like turtlenecks and lace, but I feel like not necessarily in a romantic way, so maybe I should say rarely. Alright, sporty. Now, I'm not sporty but I do like athleisure. - [Tyler] Yes. I like leisure. I edit most of my days. - [Tyler] Well we have that bike desk. I don't use it, but I like it. - [Tyler] You like what it stands for. Yes. Oh, and then the next one is glam which I would say I am rarely glam. Nothing against glam. Good for glam. - [Tyler] Good for glam? You know, wam bam hand in the glam. It's usually just, "wam bam hand in the clam." - [Tyler] No it's - wam bam thank you ma'am. What? - [Tyler] Where did this clam reference come from? I don't even know. Okay, so the next one is minimal. In a sort of monochromatic way, I am minimal, but I do like dramatic flourishes. So I would say I'm sometimes minimal. I would say that's pretty fair. And then the last flat lay is retro. Now I do enjoy a good decade fashion adventure, but I'm not sure my daily style is retro. So I'm gonna say rarely and then click "next". Let's see what else they have in the store for me. Ooh, all right. This is a question about brands. Oh no, I'm never good at these. Which of the following are in your closet? Adidas, yes. Alo yoga, yes. Amazon essentials? They have their own brand? See, I told you they're coming for everyone's merkin. - [Tyler] They make everybody's merkin. I mean, it seems like Amazon will soon be the worldwide manufacturer of merkins, so everyone hang on to yours. Yeah, I don't have that many brands. I have like one pair of Calvin Klein underwear and four pairs of Calin Kelun underwear, so um. I don't see him on here. I'm pretty disappointed about that. Oh, Ugg is on here. I do have one very large pair of Uggs, so I feel like that counts. - [Tyler] You shouldn't be including products from videos though. See, but if I don't then I only have like one brand checked, so. - [Tyler] Ok, got it. Ah, so the next question is about colors and patterns that I dislike. Hm. I feel like I should be honest and click everything. - [Tyler] Yeah I'll leave like the neutrals on, but I'm gonna get rid of colors just so they know that. So currently what's left on there are: neutrals, grays, blacks, and silvers. This is embarrassing for some reason. I feel exposed. So the next section is asking me how often I wear different clothing items. First up is dresses. I'm gonna say I often wear dresses actually. When I shave my legs. For like the week after that I wear only dresses. Jeans. I'm not against them, but I do rarely reach for them. Pants, same deal. If it's not stretchy it's not that I don't like it, it's that I don't wear it. All right, next. Ah, now it's asking me how I feel about specific trends. Midi-length dresses and skirts. I'm actually a big fan of like midi and maxi length things. Partially because it minimizes the amount of leg you have to shave and also because you can kind of sweep around. You know, you have kind of like a butt cape. - [Tyler] A lot of your clothing decisions centralize around leg hair. Leg hair and also dramatic flourishes. Do I have to shave my legs and can I pretend I'm Snape? Ooh-hoo! The next trend is bell sleeves. Let me just smash that "love it" button. Circle. Hole. What? - [Tyler] Smash that hole? I didn't realize it sounded like that. Obviously, I am a giant fan of bell sleeves, bat wing sleeves, giant sleeves, really dramatic sleeves of any kind, so they can send these to me all they want. Okay, so the next question is about my body shape. I think I'm straight up and down. I think I've got wide shoulders and wide hips but not necessarily like a really small waist. I think I'm just straight up and down. - [Tyler] You're like celery. What did we say in that video we did? The perfect makeover video? - [Tyler] You're like a rhubarb. Rhubarb, I've got the rhubarb body type. Tyler's into it. - [Tyler] Yeah. The next couple of sections of the quiz are asking me how I like different clothing items to fit, how much I like to highlight different parts of my body, my height and my weight, and my general sizes. And they're also giving me an opportunity to leave a little extra fit info for the stylist. Oh, maybe I should tell them I have a big booty? - [Tyler] Okay. I have decently long legs and kind of a big booty. FYI. Alright, next. And then there are even more questions. Including some about my budget, for which I'm just gonna check towards the middle of each category, and then a series of questions about how often I'd like to receive certain vibes of items like: business-y, going to the club-y, snug-y. Those kinds of things. And with that, I am finally at the end of this quiz. It's gonna let me save my style profile, so let's do that. I'm gonna click "continue". Alright, so this is about my payment information. - [Tyler] Don't they know everything already? They do, they do, they do. Ah ha, my personal shopper subscription is confirmed, and next up they're gonna notify me when my stylist's pics are ready. So presumably in a few days that real life, not robot, stylist is gonna reach out to me and recommend me some stuff to wear. So I'll see you guys then. Alright. So it's a few days later, and I've received a notification that my Amazon shopper has picked out a few things for me to go through and see what I like from them. Tyler: Choose from? That's better. In general, I haven't been like contacted by any person besides this push notification like I haven't chatted with anyone on the phone or like DM to anyone but I did participate in like a Tinder style survey where Amazon like gave me selections and then I would like swipe left or right if I liked them or not So that did provide them like a little more information than just the quiz that we took but besides that that's it Okay, so I guess we should just open up the app and see what's up Shall we haha, my pics already I've clicked in Okay, so they sent me a list of like 10 clothing items presumably based off of my style profile So they say that I should choose two to eight items from this list to try on at home for free There's two jackets on here two dresses For tops one pair of leggings and one pair of shoes They all seem to be name brands that I recognize so we're definitely on the Bloomies side of Amazon versus the Romwe side with the average price being about $60 per item. Overall These clothes look pretty decent if a little plain But I'm gonna hold off any real judgement until I can see them in person Maybe I should try on eight just so we can see The most possible which means that two of these clothing items are getting out Vitas aimed right now I think that I am going to Leave out this gray turtleneck sweater just because it's not really doing a lot for me and I can't really see myself Keeping it. So I'm not gonna waste its time. And then the second item I'm gonna boot is this jean jacket I feel like although I do wear denim jackets a lot Getting a plain denim jacket to try on is not the most exciting thing. - [Tyler] No So I think I'm gonna eliminate that one as well and then we'll go with everything else basically So I'm going to say review and ship and we will see these items when they arrive here And we can try them on. So next time you see me I'll have my haul. Alright so it's about a week later and we are here and ready to unbox, I mean, unbag our Amazon personal shopper haul. - [Tyler] Oh, wow. It's a pretty big sack. - [Tyler] You just slammed that thing There's nothing fragile in there, is there? - [Tyler] No, there isn't. Alright. So this is my sack. - [Tyler] This is your sack? This is my sack - [Tyler] Okay, you're saying sack a lot I feel compelled to say sack it feels right in my mouth. - [Tyler] Oh my god [wheeze] Sorry, why am I so raunchy today? - [Tyler] I don't know. Ooh alright first up is I believe a white denim or linen jacket I kind of like this jacket actually when I see it in person. It's got a little bit of like a Waist cincher and it also has like some nice like cargo sort of like military jacket vibes. It feels nice It's definitely the right weight for a Los Angeles jacket. - [Tyler] So it's like barely a jacket. It's barely a jacket Yeah, but that's the kind of jacket you need in LA. So I'm not angry about that. - [Tyler] We can mock it but it's practical Alright, so that is item one of eight. What's next out of my bag of tricks? Ooh Exciting stuff this is the linen peasant blouse This looks very Comfy actually a little similar to a different like peasant shirt that I own that I've worn in a fair amount of videos actually So this is not a terrible pick, but maybe not the most exciting pick. - [Tyler] No It's cute and -Serviceable for now. We'll see how it fits. We'll see how it fits. 
- [Tyler] Yeah. 
- Ooh Alright, here is another black item. I think this is our black t-shirt they taped this one seriously - [Tyler] they do not want you to get into that thing Why? What the actual heck is going on. - [Tyler] Is it double bagged? I don't know--ooh This is cute. Actually, I would say online um It looked like slightly Underwhelming but actually in person I like the fabric the seam down the middle and the knot detail It's a very very conservative version of the hit me baby one more time It's like I will tie up my shirt act wear my jeans end. Okay, so next up We've got this lump. Look ma, it's a lump. - [Tyler] It looks something came out of a vending machine kind of That is totally next up for Amazon. Yes, clothing vending machines Wow. I just gave them a free idea. You're welcome All right. So here's a cute white wrap top. Oh - The fronts open. 
- [Tyler] Oh, yeah? 
- I'm flashing myself It is a little business casual and I am pretty much in a place in my life where I have no need for business casual clothing and I think I told them that but you know, we'll see how it looks on. Maybe it reads a little more casual on the body All right, what's next? Ah, I believe these are the leggings. Whoo The fabric of these is really soft. Tyler, feel this reach out and feel this. Suddenly it's turned into a leggings ad. Oh, yeah reach out and feel this, Rhonda - [Tyler] Rhonda? I'm trying to be like a home shopping network type person now I did tell them that I liked yoga pants and these do feel pretty promising but as a sort of like item that was picked Out for me personally by a stylist. Once again, I would say it's a little bit of a safe choice. - [Tyler] Very safe. Yeah. It's like I'm gonna buy a lady in her 20s yoga pants. What! We like those? That's wild. All right, so next up. We have this gray sweater dress, which is very cute I like the neckline and I like these little things around the sleeves, but I am a little concerned about the thickness of the knit I thought that this dress might be more of like a where whenever like thin dress and this is definitely a sweater dress Like I feel the warmth I feel like they didn't 100% take into account my location for this one Like if I still lived in Chicago, I would be pleased with this. But I don't. - [Tyler] Something that like a personal stylist should know I mean Amazon definitely knows that All right, let me roll this thing up and then we'll move on to the second to last item - [Tyler] the penultimate the penultimate item - [Tyler] Oh, that's cute. Whoo, I like this pattern. - [Tyler] What are those? I think they're stars here. Let me like unfurl. Oh - [Tyler] This is definitely your style This is definitely up my alley. There are a lot of features on this dress that strike my fancy I like the like fit-and-flare. I do like the sort of um corset neckline situation even if it doesn't look good on me, this is Probably a good pick like from a online personal shopper I would say that this is a good shot a good (Tyler: stab) a good stab (a good stab) I declare Cute. Ow We should get a gavel. - [Tyler] We don't need a gavel. I need a gavel dear Amazon personal shopper dear Bezos can you send me a gavel? So that is item seven out of eight and then our final item is a pair of shoes and If I remember correctly These are a pair of white studded backless mules - [Tyler] those these are like straight out of the Elton John biopic Yeah, I was gonna say for some reason. These are giving me like somewhere in between Elvis Presley and Kris Jenner Bedroom slippers, does that make sense at all? - [Tyler] You know you throw some sunglasses on and give her a microphone and I think Kris Jenner could like be a stand-in for Elvis That's not the worst call. It's not perfect, but it's not the worst These shoes are an interesting choice and sort of like a judge on Project Runway or Top Chef I have to give them points for trying something. (Tyler: Yeah) this is not like a sort of neutral white top or great dress This is like a studded  mule So with all of our items de-sacked, let's get them on my body and see how they look -[Tyler] The King Kardashian lives So after trying on our eight items There were some hits some misses and some close but no cigars and out of those I would say that there are four items I'm pretty sure I'm not gonna keep first being the white linen jacket. In general, this is quite a comfortable jacket It's very light and the cut of it is okay But a white linen jacket just seems pretty hard to maintain So I don't think I would wear it Especially since I'm used to rubbing spills into my jacket rather than off of it - [Tyler] I can already envision like mustard stains on this thing. Yeah. I eat a lot of mustard. Mustard, hot sauce, coffee I consume a lot of stain-ful items. Like I've said before I'm a sauce gal That's a problem with the white jacket. The second item that's going back to Bezos is the black also linen peasant top I feel like my problem with this top is that it is close to a top that I already like so it's kind of in Like an uncanny valley in between a hill. That is I have a top that's like this So I do like this style and another Hill that well if I like that top better than I should keep this top the fabric Of it is also kind of stiff and wrinkle prone which isn't awesome I feel like with like a peasant top you might want to just be able to sort of throw it on a little bit more than like a shirt you have to like steam and unwrinkle. The third item that's getting returned is the white wrap top. Usually I'm a medium fan of like wrap style tops but this is an actual wrap top like there is holes in it and like I actually have to wrap it together and it could become unwrapped and then I could flash people so it not only feels kind of precarious but also I don't think it is the most flattering style on me. So it is out along with the gray inappropriate for LA sweater dress. it is warm and comfortable like what I'm feeling myself Like I am liking what I'm feeling, but it's fitting me a little bit weird once it's on my body - [Tyler] It's like a pillowcase. Maybe it should have been like more body con or just like more flowy (Tyler: Yeah) It's kind of like in-between, which is pretty unfortunate because I do like the sleeves I like how long they are. And they've also wrapped my wrists or sort of like forearms like a present. - [Tyler] They're slightly mummified what I thought when I saw it mummy meets Christmas present. Besides those there are two items in our haul that I'm kind of on the fence about One being the black knot detail shirt I actually like this one on - [Tyler] There's not a lot not to like it looks pretty standard. It is fairly standard, I'll be honest, but it's quite comfortable I really like like sort of like lightweight feel and I do like the knot detail bring it around town. I feel like my hesitancy comes from the fact that it's kind of plain and it just doesn't feel like something that I couldn't Find myself at a variety of other stores But I still might keep it the second item that I'm not so sure about is the yoga pants these yoga pants are Incredibly comfortable sort of like a nice soft teddy bear around my thighs But they are maybe a hair big. I think it's because they're not super like Hug, or they're not really like rump lifting yoga pants They're kind of like lounging yoga pants and I prefer at least a little snapback action from my leggings I'm a little bit disappointed that these are too big because otherwise I would Definitely keep these and I am leaning towards returning these and buying these exact leggings in one size smaller It seems like Tyler is on Team keep though. You want a pair Tyler? - [Tyler] I'll take that pair Yeah, I'll buy a smaller pair and you'll wear this pair - [Tyler] just hand them over to me. I think we've figured it out I think that's what we're gonna do and then the final two items of the haul I'm actually leaning towards keeping the first one of which is this black starry dress Alright, okay. I like this dress. - [Tyler] Yeah, me too This one is definitely one of the more exciting pics from the stylist. I would say it is like okay, it has details It's a dress. It has a pattern. It's got sleeves, you know, there's something to it - [Tyler] Yeah It's a garment with a little style and besides the silhouette and the details the pattern is Definitely up my alley. It's a little witchy (Tyler: Yeah) a little celestial a little I want to say woman of the night, but I know that has different connotations But you know what? I mean? - [Tyler] Yeah, like a modern Sanderson sister Yes sistahs grab your vacuums! Tonight: we fly! Besides the dress I think we all knew the Elvis Jenner slides had to be a winner. - [Tyler] Alright. Those are a hard keep come on Though I have no idea what to wear them with. I feel strangely drawn to them in general. They are interesting (Tyler: Yeah) they are a conversation piece. They are out there and even though I would not have picked these out for myself I respect the stylist for going out on a limb to try to show me a new look - [Tyler] They are unbelievable. I want these things, Saf Elvis Jenner loafers, they're a thing. Don't look it up So that was our Amazon personal shopper haul. In general I think that all of the pics were nice quality But overall I would not say I was wowed all of the things they picked out for me It could reasonably be justified by my answers on the quiz But most of them were pretty safe or middle-of-the-road selections and it definitely didn't seem like they were trying to show me the range of what Amazon has to offer or any up-and-coming trends in fact I don't think we saw anything that they said was a trend from that one portion of the quiz and I think when you evaluate What a personal shopper brings to the table You kind of want someone who is better at shopping than you or who knows more about fashion than you do like with Rachel Green And Joey's murse this is a great bag Okay, and it's as handy as it is becoming which may not have been the right choice But hey, at least she tried now the service does say that they try to improve their picks as you use it over time But I feel like they could do a better job Faster if you could actually chat with your stylist But we never heard from any human at any point - [Tyler] where's, like, the personalized note, you know, like an explanation I would have loved a note. (Tyler: Yeah) I would have really loved a note I wish I knew who my stylist was Alexa just pipes up from the corner "it was me" Interestingly on the FAQ page for this service they kind of imply that there may not actually be a person styling you and it might all be an Algorithm, so you may just be paying for a conglomeration of the suggested for you bar I'm not saying that's definitely what's happening, but it seems possible All of that said I wouldn't say the service was terrible It was about the same as any other style box service It just wasn't very exciting which is kind of disappointing given how much weird crap there is on Amazon I actually think I would highly enjoy an Amazon personal shopper sending me random gadgets I actually might like that more than this But who knows? Maybe I'm just salty that I still have hair on my head and I do not have a killer vest That's all I really wanted.

Today, we have some bonus wedding content for you [Tyler] This is the full version of our first dance, which was a recreation of the tango scene from The Addams Family Values. [Safiya] What can I say? I'm a Morticia stan. [Tyler] Now, as some of you guys might know, we recently posted a full wedding vlog, which featured a fair amount of our first dance, [Safiya] but we weren't able to put the actual music in, because it would get copyright claimed, and then, like, Paramount or Atlas, or whoever would claim our entire wedding video. So we decided to post our first dance by itself as a little bonus video, here- just in case it gets taken down, it's not taking the rest of the wedding vlog down with it. So with that, here is our first dance. [Tyler] Also, quick preface: obviously, neither of us are trained or pro-dancers in any way. So, please don't roast us, this was just for fun. [LOUDSPEAKER: Ladies and gentlemen, your bride and groom's first dance together as husband and wife.] [AUDIENCE: APPLAUSE AND CHEERING] [MUSIC BEGINS]
Addams Family Values: The Original Orchestral Score
Track #8 - The Tango [MUSIC PLAYING] [APPLAUSE AND CHEERING] [Safiya] So that was our first dance. I think it went pretty well. There were a few hiccups, here and there. [Tyler] I got a little lost in the moment, and went for, like, the second buns-a-rollin' spin, so Saf lost a little momentum on the ground, and had to be like, dragged up. But we improvised. 
[Safiya] We made it work. [Tyler] We made it work . 
[Safiya] As Tim Gunn says. [Safiya] Overall, it was so much fun learning and performing this dance. It was definitely one of the highlights of the night for me, and I think our family and friends thought it was fun too. [Tyler] There were a lot of shocked faces. Next up, real knives and real backflips. [CONCERN and FLASHBACKS] Or not. [LAUGHTER] [Safiya] Thank you guys so much for watching, and once again, a huge thank you to our cinematographers, Amari Productions, for helping us film all of this wedding content.

[Safiya] Hello, friends And welcome to our wedding video. That's right, we are no longer engaged! betrothed or affianced! [Tyler] Despite how many times you've said that, [Safiya] We are married, Wedded, matrimonied! [Tyler] Yes we are! [Safiya] So back in November, we got married, which we may have spoiled in this Instagram post where Tyler is wearing his wedding ring [Tyler] Yeah, I think some of you guys might have figured it out. [Safiya] And we had so much fun at our wedding It was such an incredible night, [Tyler] that we really wanted to share it with you guys. -[Safiya] Hence the wedding video, hence. 
- [Tyler] Hence [Safiya] Now we've edited this video to be a little different than like a traditional wedding highlight video, mostly because we wanted to show you guys the day from our perspective, but also to provide some of our thought process that went into the planning and like the design decisions and stuff, because we had a really great time putting it all together and choosing all the things. [Tyler] Now before we jump in we wanted to say a huge thank you to our cinematographers, Amari productions, who did an amazing job filming, [Safiya] and also helping make sure that I didn't pick up a camera all day, because I was really nervous. I was just gonna like grab one and start filming b-roll of the venue. [Tyler] Me too [Safiya] Yeah [Tyler] We also want to say thank you to our wedding planner Marnie at So Smitten Special Events, who's been unbelievably helpful the last couple of months. [Safiya] There's not a ton of footage of Marnie because she was zipping around doing stuff all night - But you'll see her here and there. 
- [Tyler] Here and there. Also, thank you to all of our other vendors as well, for helping make our big day so special. [Tyler] So with that, here's what happened on our wedding day. [Safiya] And I guess the best place to start is with us getting ready in the morning I stayed at like a hotel the night before, [Tyler] I was with Crusty... at home [Safiya] So that way the morning of, all of the ladies like involved in the wedding could get their hair and makeup done in my room. It was kind of poppin'. I had a face mask on for most of it And then around 10 a.m. Dave and the Amari Productions crew stopped by to start filming. All right. Hello. We're getting ready. We're getting ready. We've been getting ready for a few hours actually There's been a lot of people in and out you guys are here now other people were here earlier [Tyler] You had like a caravan of relatives, I just had the cat. [Safiya] But we had my mom got her makeup done. We had Tyler's mom get her makeup done We had Tyler sister get her makeup done cuz she's the officiant but also because she's Tyler sister and then we also got my bridesmaids get their makeup and hair done. Are my bridesmaids here? 
-Yeah. Yeah Some of them we're at Target a second ago. So I was just checking in but we have the bridesmaids in the house. We have Kaitlyn somewhere. "Woo" from the distance. [Laughs] A distant woo was heard. Oh also, um, this is my wonderful glam team. I should have started with that. It's okay. This is Kaylee Melissa doing my hair - [Kaylee Melissa] Hi 
- [Safiya] of decade video fame [Laughs] And this is Yuki who's doing my makeup. [Yuki] Hi! and I would say in general we're going for kind of like a um, [Ringing] and then [Ringing] - [Tyler] Who was calling you? 
- [Safiya] No one ever told me. It's just a mystery. For the hair, we wanted to go for kind of like There is a lot going on. There's a lot of hair. I think my general hair and makeup goal was just to have something that would match the fantastical meets medieval vibes of my dress and my dad did tell me that I ended up looking like Aragorn's girlfriend So I think we succeeded. We're almost done with my makeup I think except for the finishing touch the lips where I shall be wearing one of our ColourPop Franken-Lipsticks [evil laughter] - Shameless plug it's happening. It's my wedding day. It's fine. No one can tell me no. [Laugh]
- [Tyler] That was, uh, really smooth [Tyler] That was, uh, really smooth. [Safiya] I stand by. It my nails also got done not today, but Christine did them yesterday So it's simplynailogical. There's actually no good b-roll of my simply nails here But there is a shot of me picking Tyler's nose later. So keep an eye out for that. [Tyler] That did happen. So with my hair and makeup done, it was time to do like a looking into the mirror for the first time reveal Which I did not anticipate being so emotional because I, I pretty much immediately started crying There is a lot of my crying face in this video, so just know that [Tyler] Don't worry about it. I cry a lot in this video. [Safiya] Okay. All right. That's not what I expected to do Ok I'm fine! So after my sob sesh We stuffed me into an uber and headed over to our venue the Carondelet House. [Tyler] Where I had been basically all day Okay, so we are here at the Carondelet house, which is our venue This is like our dude lounge for me and my groomsmen I was supposed to do our first check-in like this at my house and then I got like kind of uh lost in the fray So I had mistakenly go into the Carondelet house first and the cinematographers had correctly go into our house first So when they got to our house, they thought that I had bailed. [Safiya] Runaway groom! [Tyler] I was just overeager! But I, I feel like this is fine for us to do a check-in here. My house is really dirty. Crusty my cat, if you don't know him, has been just dragging litter everywhere So it's better than we're here. 
The other dynamic of my morning was that we forgot to give me wedding shoes outright So I'm gonna trade shoes with my dad For the ceremony and I had to stuff them with toilet paper just to get them to fit. Hey, you know what? That's that is gonna help pretty snug now So yeah shoes didn't think about that, but wait back up after those two mini fire drills. My groomsmen started showing up This one is Sean and besides Sean, we also had Ben, Block, my brother-in-law James, and my dad who was actually my best man Dad: dun-dun-daa *shoo* [Tyler] And once everyone was there, it was time for me to get dressed. And I wore a black velvet tuxedo jacket. [Dad] Looks great! I'm gonna be sweating either way I think just cuz you know the vows and all that stuff. There's a lot of lights out there and then as a finishing touch We have a rare Marnie sighting here. [Safiya] The Marnicle! [Tyler] as I got boutonniered-up. So that was my wedding look. [Safiya] Looking fly [Tyler] Thank you. Is this "ready to get married"? Now while Tyler was downstairs getting dressed I was upstairs Hangin with my gang in the bridal suite and I think I'm about to get dressed. I think that's what's on the schedule So let's do it. Now. I actually needed some assistance to get into my gown because besides being pretty awesome [Tyler] It's so cool [Safiya] It also ended up being kind of fragile that too and of course classic me as soon as I got into it [Tyler] That too. [Safiya] And, of course, classic me, as soon as I got into it I started getting teary eyed. I was just blubbering all day. I feel like actually a fair amount of the audience has seen this dress in muslin form We ended up choosing this beaded scalloped patterned fabric which has kind of like an Art Deco/mermaid feel to it Also, I didn't realize this would happen when I chose the fabric, but the dress is 30 pounds I can't tell that it's 30 pounds of just, like, bead basically just beads and though our fabric was heavy and kind of had a mind of its own, I don't regret our choice at all because I really loved how it ended up looking Like it's inevitable, but I'm gonna try and not crunch while I walk down the aisle So after that, we added my finishing touches, like my jewelry. I'm just like where's my ear? Literally where? As well as a gold celestial headpiece. As well as a gold celestial headpiece. Now Kaylee and I had a really hard time finding" the right one" like we were looking for months So she actually ended up making this one herself and it turned out so perfect like she just totally nailed it. She did [Tyler] She did. [Safiya] All right, so I think I am generally styled downstairs and see Tyler so we decided to do this thing called a first-look which is basically like a moment before the ceremony So we decided to do this thing called a "first-look" which is basically like a moment before the ceremony where the bride and the groom reveal themselves to each other. [Tyler] That sounds wrong. [Safiya] Mostly to get rid of some nerves but also so you can like start hanging out together and also take some pictures before the ceremony and also take some pictures before the ceremony I'm ready. Oh my god - [Safiya] We are a couple of sad sacks. 
- [Tyler] We're not good at this. [Safiya] Ready? Whoa [Tyler] Oh wow [Safiya] We did eventually pull it together. [Tyler] We de-blubbered. [Safiya] It's kind of crazy to me that we remembered so many little things but we forgot your shoes. [Tyler] To be fair, they're supposed to be on my feet and I didn't even think of them [Safiya] So after checking each other out, The general consensus was that up next, it was photo time. [[SIMPLYNAILOGICAL NAILS SPOT]] So we took a bunch of photos both inside the little atrium area where we had the first look and also outside the front of the Carondelet house, both with each other and with our bridal party [Tyler] We had a hard time being serious for these ones Cheers. Hey, hey Cheers. Heyheyhey [Safiya] It's like uh, bey-beyblades?? [Tyler] Beyblades?? with that that one came out. It's an analogy for marriage. Our photographer. Alex was very patient with us. Yeah [Safiya] Was that what I'm talking about? [Tyler] It's an analogy for marriage. [Safiya] Our photographer, Alex was very patient with us. [Tyler] Yeah he's a cool guy. [Safiya] Its like the tops that fight each other. I think its beyblades! [Tyler] Yeah, ok. [Safiya] We'll look it up. So we filmed this next portion of the video as like the last thing we did before the guests started arriving mostly to quell my own nerves because I really wanted to get footage of everything and I was irrationally nervous that we wouldn't. So we did like a tour for you guys of the whole venue But just a heads-up, it wasn't 100% set up yet. Now our general wedding theme was "A starry night." So we had a lot of stars and moons and twinkle lights going on However, because of the rooms near the entrance of the Carondelet house are already pretty decorated in like a vintage manner style, we reserved most of the celestial trimmings for the back of the house and left this stuff up here kind of as it was And we were kind of thinking of it almost like a Narnia situation where these front rooms were like the professor's house, and then as you venture deeper into the building, there was more magic afoot. We choose an espresso martini because it's brown like Crusty, and also because it's very caffeinated. [Tyler] Kind of like a classy Four Loko. [Safiya] Moving on from the front foyers, there was this little hallway in between the front of the house and the back of the house So we decided to deck it out and make it like the entrance to Narnia And these hanging stars were actually our escort cards. So people could figure out where they were sitting for dinner after that There was the First Look atrium, Tyler's little lounge situation, and then we had our main ceremony space, which I would say is the room we tried to deck-out the most. The other reason I wanted to have this cloudy sky backdrop, was that in this main room, they actually have like a big non-removable mirror in the back, which I just wasn't sure we wanted as like such a strong focal point of the ceremony. And then finally, we had this back atrium where our photo booth was gonna go. Which had like this cool, old-timey moon as the centerpiece. And with our photo booth area visited, that concluded our tour. After that, it was time for all of us to go hide upstairs in the bridal suite, because our guests were starting to arrive. [Tyler] All right so, [Tyler] No, this is not a bit. - [Both] Kaylee has super glue! 
- [Tyler] There you go. Jinx, but uh, yeah. No, let's do that [Safiya] There was just so much going on with Tyler's shoes. I think maybe that was like our Charlotte and Harry moment, like from Sex in the City. Like little things have to go wrong at your wedding. [Tyler] But after gluing my soles together and a few final to-do's, [Safiya] It was pretty much time to make it official-- like official-official. [Tyler] All right. They were just about to walk in I'm walking down with my niece and my mom so we'll see how it goes. I'm definitely feeling some butterflies, but we got this. [Safiya] Now, as we mentioned earlier, Tyler's sister was our officiant, so she was our first person down the aisle. Then we had Tyler, Tyler's mom, and baby Ellie. Then we had the whole bridal party [Tyler] looking spiffy [Safiya] And then it was finally my turn to walk down the aisle. [Officiant] Welcome everyone. Please have a seat. I know everyone is as excited as I am to be gathered here in LA to celebrate the marriage of Safiya and Tyler. [Safiya] Now we're actually gonna keep a lot of the ceremony and like most of our vows off of the internet. We wrote them ourselves They're kind of mushy. We cried, we laughed, Tyler called himself a dingus. [Tyler] "So if you really want to marry this dingus, let's do it." [Tyler] It's what I wanted to say originally when I proposed, so I had to work it in. [Safiya] My vows were kind of all over the place, I talked about zombies for a while-- [Tyler] that was actually pretty relevant to our early relationship-- [Safiya] I exposed some of our intimate secrets-- [Tyler] Yeah, you did-- [Safiya] "And I will pop your pimples even when they are in unspeakable crevices [Tyler] "Aw!" [Safiya] But they were good, I think! [Tyler] I loved them. [Safiya] Besides all of that, we did actually want to show you guys this one thing that we brought to the ceremony [Officiant] "Safiya and Tyler have chosen to affirm their love by the lighting of a unity candle this candle is actually made by Safiya and Tyler last year while filming a video for their YouTube channel, and is called their Franken-candle." [Safiya] Now when our wedding planner asked us if we wanted to do a unity candle, we knew that we had the perfect candle for the job, so we had to do it. [Safiya] "Also I'm sorry guys if it smells like blueberry pancakes in here. - It's the candle, not me " 
- [Tyler] "It's a dominant scent." 
- [Safiya] "Yeah, it's a dominant scent." So after that We cried a little more We did the whole ring thing, - [Tyler] And you know, the actual marriage part-- 
- [Safiya] And then, [Officiant] "By the power vested in me, I pronounce you as a newly married couple! You may kiss each other." [Safiya] And that was our ceremony [Safiya] We were married. [Tyler] We're still married. [Safiya] We're married! [Tyler] There you go. Alright so, How was that? Did I cry too much, you think? [Safiya] No I don't think you cried too much. - [Tyler] No? 
- [Safiya] No. I thought we got through our vows pretty well pretty well. I do. [Tyler] Pretty well! We had a nice guest appearance by Ellie here and there [Safiya] "Well-timed! Well-timed!" [Tyler] But I overall I thought I thought it went great. [Safiya] It's probably stinking up the place right now. [Tyler] It's probably going to turn everyone's appetite off. Are you ok? A lil still emotional? Ok. Ok! Let's go take some pictures! Newly married couple. - [Safiya] Oh, mine's like totally off center. 
- [Tyler] Yeah. 
- [Safiya] We'll figure it out. 
- [Tyler] We'll figure it out. [Safiya] So after that, we had to take some family pics before the sun set [Tyler] and then we went into cocktail hour. [Safiya] Now while everyone was in the front foyers for Crustinis and appetizers, The ceremony space in the back was actually getting flipped into our dinner space, [Tyler] Oooooooh yeeaah. [Tyler] looks pretty incredible. Wow! [Safiya] which we got to get a little peek of. For our dinner tables, we have like gray velvet tablecloths with black and gold flatware and plates and also little like personalized moons to designate where everyone was sitting. And for our centerpieces, we had a variety of antiquey vampy library paraphernalia. Like Beauty and the Beast style terrariums, vintage looking books, and mossy florals. Yes And then we had our sweetheart table at the front of the room Which had more of those mossy flowers as well as a lot of black candles. But dinner time was quickly approaching. [Tyler] So after everyone took their seats, we and our bridal party did like our grand entrance thing. [DJ] Please help me with a huge round of applause as we welcome in our newly married couple! Give it up for Safiya and Tyler! [Safiya] I think sometimes people plan stuff for their entrances, but we kind of forgot so everyone just did their own thing - [Safiya] I think they might have spilled like directly onto simplybenlogical's head. 
- [Tyler] Sorry about that Ben. [Safiya] But anyway after a little dinner and doing the rounds saying hi to everyone, we were onto the toast portion of the evening Starting with Tyler's dad. [Tyler's Dad] Now I am extremely honored to have had Tyler asked me to be the best man so I could give a toast but interestingly enough, this is not the first time I've given a toast at a wedding of Tyler and Safiya. Now as we all know because we are all loyal subscribers and we all "shamash" the like button and we "shamash" the subscribe button, [Safiya]  I don't know why everyone's laughing. I mean, I hope they're all subscribed [Tyler's Dad] They had a wedding in Hong Kong this summer and at that wedding, I gave a very impromptu toast which was not very good. Safiya was very kind and she said and I quote." Well, that wasn't half bad." No, it was all bad trust me it was really bad, in fact it wasn't even close to the best toast That was given that day The best toast was from our Hong Kong hosts Thomas and Winkle and it was "Apple. Apple, May your hearts be joined as an apple." So, I'm extremely happy to have a chance to take a mulligan and redo and see if I can at least get to the level of Thomas and Winkle. [Tyler] Now, we're not gonna put his whole speech here But I do think he did a great job with his toast definitely got some of the emotional stuff in there. [Safiya] But I think he was also able to like bring a lot of different things into the mix like our MacDonald's wedding, promoting our channel, Shakespeare. [Tyler's Dad] Because as we all know, loyal subscribers and viewers, Safiya is a big fan of Shakespeare. [Safiya] We got some Henry V, a little Tempest. [Tyler] And he really got the crowd going. [Safiya] Now my dad gave the second toast and as you can probably tell by his guitar he also played a song [Safiya's Dad] Let me just say a few words about Safiya and Tyler. Of course, I have two really wonderful children. And now I have Tyler as one more guy so we're very happy about that. He's not really much of a speech guy [Safiya] He's not really much of a speech guy. I would say, but I think he did a great job [Tyler] Yeah, I loved it! [Safiya] And after that he and my brother played a little cover of Yesterday by the Beatles, but with altered lyrics. [Safiya's Dad] I'll start by making an apology to Sir Paul McCartney because we could gonna mess up one of his beautiful songs, but We'll do what we can. [Safiya] my dad actually used to be in a Beatles cover band in the 60s in Denmark And I think it's been a little while since he's picked up a guitar But recently he and my brother have been like jamming. Unfortunately, we can't actually play their song for you guys because it would get copyright claimed but it was really sweet and I completely lost it. Basically. [DJ] Yes, one more round of applause! For the father and brother of the bride [Safiya] Now before we could really let loose, as some of you may know, we did have this whole change into a black wedding dress choreographed first dance thing on the docket. So after the toasts we had to run upstairs because I had to get changed in like five minutes [Safiya] Yes we are in the middle of a costume change The MVP right now. cuz Yuki's touching me up. [Safiya] I really was a mess. And besides Yuki trying to salvage my face and a little bit of a lipstick change, Hayley was also pulling my hair back for partying purposes. [Tyler] More aerodynamic. [Safiya] And she replaced my crown with some cosmic pins on the back of my head for like a Milky Way but made of hair look. And once we had at that in order, and once I was fully spruced we headed down to the dance floor because it was time to tango. So our first dance was actually a recreation of the tango scene from The Addams Family Values. Now, unfortunately, that music is also copyrighted so we can't actually play it for you, but we did spend a few months learning this routine neither of us are dancers Neither of us are dancers, so please be gentle with us but we thought it would be fun to do like a performance situation and in addition to the choreo if there were some props some audience participation Some toreador-ing and some sleight of hand I think I pulled that off as well as this whole move where Tyler like spins me around on my butt Which may or may not be called the buns are rolling. None of our guests really knew exactly what we were going to do So I was pretty pleased that we were able to surprise them with this After that in quick succession we cut our cake which was sadly not the Franken cake, but was this beautiful All-black cake that may or may not stain your mouth. We did like the father-daughter mother-son dances, and also like a giant group photo And then we checked in one final time, all right, so we just did our first dance and our cake-cutting Yes, a lot of things just happen. We're both kind of sweaty Tyler's teeth are a little bit black are my lips also red everything everything, but it's like purple I was super super nervous for the dance. Yes. I think that all things considered we did a pretty good job Yes I think there were like a couple hiccups here and there I went for the second but to roll in spin on the ground We'll have to film a dance practice video. So people can see the full buns are rolling. I think what we recovered Yes, I got angry Yeah an entire look dragged me up but it worked and we're going to do it and we got the kiss and I think I got the knife in my mouth at The right time that was fun. I thought I also have never done it with the lighter and Good thing that didn't happen. I think it's time for us to party and have fun Let's do it. After that. The rest of the night was mostly just partying. We hit up that sick Good night moon photobooth Even though Tyler's mouth was still a little purple and then we just like broke it down on the dance floor Would you say we tore it up? Yes There was just like an endless stream of go to wedding songs a little shout a little journey a little Britney and then we finished Off the night with some dancing queen Which is always a solid choice and we were just really happy that everyone was there and we just had a really good time. So That was our wedding Oh also one last thing when I threw the bouquet I accidentally hit one of our editors Claire in the face But she has assured us that she still had fun. So we're all good on that front a huge. Thank you to everyone Who came to our wedding as well as everyone who was involved. I've put everyone's links in the description below So make sure to check them out. And yeah, that's the gist of it TL DW were married We're married pound it. Hell. Yeah.

This week, I'm gonna be getting a custom black wedding dress. Y'all can stop tweeting me now. It's happening! Now, as some of you might know, I am engaged, betrothed, affianced, and a few months ago we went shopping for my wedding dress and we ended up picking out a really amazing gown, with some pretty epic medieval sleeves. "Look at that sleeve Ty!" With a couple of details still left up in the air, like the fabric and the final fit, but we said "Sure to the frock". And that dress is still gonna be my wedding dress but, for a while I've been teasing the idea of doing a White Swan/Black Swan moment, and having a second dress that I can change into for the party portion of the evening. So that is what we're gonna be working on now. The Odile dress, if you will, or the Mila Kunis one. Unless you think she's just a figment of Natalie Portman's imagination. That movie came out in 2010, I don't know why I'm still talking about it. Now the first question some of you may be asking is "Why do you want a black wedding dress at all?" Well, I wear a lot of black. It started off as like a theater kid, stagehand thing. Yes, I was a theater kid. No one is surprised. And that predilection has now taken over my life, and closet, entirely. So, a black wedding dress is definitely in my wheelhouse. In fact, some of you were surprised when I chose a white dress at all. Now, my line of thinking this whole time has been like... "If there's one occasion in my life to wear a white gown, this is it!" And I really love the Juliet dress that we chose, as well as the fabric we ended up picking out for it. However, unintentionally, the fabric we settled on is gonna end up being pretty heavy and a bit fragile. And, for some insider info, Tyler and I are planning a somewhat intricate, choreographed first dance. So I pretty much definitely need some kind of second dress to boogie in. So I thought, why not a black one? The second question you guys may have is "Why custom?" Now, there are a lot of black gowns, like, out there in the world, but when it comes to choosing a second wedding dress, I kind of want something that would both complement the first dress stylistically, but also not upstage it or downstage it too much. So kind of a tall order. But thankfully, through our shopping process for our first dress, we were able to meet the designer of it, Stephanie White, of Odylyne the Ceremony. And when she heard I was looking for a black wedding dress to complement our Juliet gown, she was intrigued. And she thought it could be really fun to work on something custom together. So I said "yes" to working on a custom dress, and thus began our journey. So to start off, we hopped on an initial FaceTime call with Stephanie to kind of game plan. -Alright, hi Stephanie! -How are you? -Doin' okay So leading up to this call, I had started pinning stuff to a shared Pinterest board as well as sharing Stephanie on our general wedding one, just so she could get a feel for the vibe we were going for. Now, our general wedding theme has kind of evolved a little bit. Initially I was describing it as A Midsummer Night's Dream, in autumn, with kind of like Christmas lights and exposed brick, but it's sort of grown into more of a Starry Night concept, as we've added a lot of decor with moravian stars, moons, and twinkly accents. I've, like, pinned a bunch of, like, celestial patterned fabrics. Um, I don't know if there's, like, that possibility out there. So most of the dresses I was gravitating towards were more on the whimsical side, with, like, beading or sheer layers, you know, just things that had some etherealness to them. There's also a fair amount of these sleeves that are, like, almost like the opposite of a bell, where they're almost like, they're poofy and, then they cinch at the wrist. So those are super cool also, So with some of my ideas out of my head and onto Pinterest, the next question was how we were gonna turn those pins into a dress. -What is our plan of attack? So our next meeting would be in person to see some of these sketched out silhouette options that Stephanie had cooked up from our conversation and then choose one of them. -That sounds perfect. -So, I will see you... next week. -All right. See you soon. -Bye! Now joining us for our sketch reviewing session was Christy Baird, who some of you may remember as the owner of LOHO Bride who helped us pick out our first dress, and was also the one who linked us up with Stephanie in the first place, and we were all gonna be taking a gander at three different silhouette options. So here is look one, which, we talked about sleeves, 'cause we know you're sleeve girl. Yeah, I am. I'm a sleeve lady. Look 1 is a generally fitted silhouette that hugs the abdomen and then starts to flare out below the hip with sheer poufy sleeves and a plunging deep V at the cleave (cleavage) point. -Something to show off a little of chest hair. Just a little bit. (Laughter) Look 2 is somewhat similar to look one in that the sleeves are also sheer and voluminous and cinched at the bottom. I feel like both of them have this, like, cool, like, gathered-ness, which I really like But instead of being fitted, Look 2 has some shearing at the waist to provide more of an a-line skirt. It also has a deep V, but it's covered by a high necked sheer overlay, sort of similar to these looks that Stephanie's designed. Look 3 is very different from the other two. -Wow This one is giving you that whole princess, fairytale vibe. -Yeah This design is off the shoulder with a notch neckline and an a-line skirt. And there's that sleeve detail Playing off of these dresses that I had pinned and also this one that I tried on way back when, at LOHO, and liked, but didn't end up picking. It would definitely give some drama, like they would definetly fly around a little bit, for sure. And honestly, after seeing them, I thought that all three of these sketches were really awesome and did hit a lot of the things that I had initially been pin-trested in. (heh-heh-heh) But I had to make a choice, and right off the bat, I had a couple of concerns with option number 3. Specifically, that it would not really solve our problem of needing a more practical dress for dancing purposes. With both the off the shoulder being restrictive to my upper arm mobility, -A lot of my girls that do off the shoulder, do it for ceremony, 'cause they want the photos Not a lot of people going the other way. as well as the cape sleeve situation, that I so loved, potentially getting in the way. -Like you might be like twirling through your own sleeve -That might happen regardless, but, like, I feel like, let's not make it harder for me So we decided to nix dress number 3. Which left us with options 1 & 2. Now, the differences between these sketches mainly come down to the neckline, of which dress 2's is quite high. -I'm nervous about, like, this kind of thing... -Getting covered? -Yeah, I don't know, not... getting covered. But I'm worried about like... I don't know somethin'. -Well, in dancing too. On the flip side... are you gonna be warm with something up this high? And besides any potential double chinning, the sheer overlay would also obscure the deep V, which I actually thought could be a good idea to highlight, because it would mirror the neckline of my other dress. So we'd have that kind of continuity going. Now, between the two skirt silhouettes, I usually favor more flowy ones, but I was actually surprisingly drawn to the more snug style. -I'm down for that. I could be up open to a booty moment. Absolutely, you see the booty hump -So between these two which one feels like the front-runner? So, all things considered, I would say that style number 1 has that practicality for dancing, with some dramatic flair, without things flying around, so it seemed like the perfect choice. -Weirdly, I can't say that I, like, knew that this dress existed, but I feel like this was kind of in my head. So we decided to go with that one. -Amazing! Okay, this is good, I'm excited. And the next step after choosing our silhouette was to have Stephanie's pattern maker whip up a muslin version of our dress for me to actually try on. -Alright... so we are here, back again, at Loho bride, and today we're gonna be meeting up with Stephanie and her pattern maker, Rita, to take a little "sneak peek" at the muslin of the black reception dress. Now, a muslin is essentially, like, a prototype version of a dress that you can use to finalize the pattern before you make it in the final fabric. -I can't wait to get into it. So I popped into the dressing room to see how it was looking. For just a rough draft, I honestly thought the dress looked pretty spooktacular. And I think a lot of the details that we had focused on in the sketch were looking good IRL. I like this shape and I love the sheer sleeves and the V. I like a lot of things! Yeah! I'm so happy about that, because I like a lot of things too. Stephanie and Rita had some standard fit alterations they wanted to make. You feelin' rock and roll? Definitely! So they pinned me up in a variety of locations. That is correct! For my part, I only felt like we needed to make small tinkers to the silhouette, like making the waistband more narrow and maybe exaggerating the sleeves slightly. So I told them to really go for it in terms of sleeve poofiness. Yeah, go big and then go home. The other thing that we needed to adjust was the length of the skirt. I wanted to make sure that we couldn't see too much of my shoes from underneath the dress, So I'm wearing, like, straight up, like, jazz shoes for, like, dancing purposes... But at the moment, there was a beautiful full-on train behind me, And unfortunately, I think it had to go for the sake of our tango Yeah, I don't think we can have any train. Otherwise, I think I'm gonna trip on it. Yeah, or he's gonna trip on it. Someone's gonna trip on it! But besides those tweaks, we were fired up for our frock. Awesome! I like it! Yeah I really... I don't just like it, I love it! And with our final silhouette within reach, it was time to pick our fabric. Spirit fingers, I guess. I don't know! Now, originally, Stephanie had thought that something like a black velvet could be good for our gown, and she had actually found a couple of Swatches of different Velvets, that she showed us on our sketch reviewing day. I keep petting this one. I feel like these feels like... You're gonna get petted. I know, However, we had already chosen a velvet tuxedo jacket for Tyler's wedding outfit and I was kind of nervous about clashing. So we took her swatches to Tyler's tux place to compare, and none of them really matched. Yeah, I feel like, unless it matches perfectly, it's not gonna make sense. Yeah, No, I can't. And with velvet more or less nixed, Stephanie suggested that we all go fabric shopping together so we could see a lot of different black fabric options in one go and then make our choice. So we met up one afternoon with two fabric stores on our itinerary: Rag Finders and Mood. Alright... So we are here at Rag Finders in downtown LA, ready to search for some fabric for our dress. Basically, Rag Finders is like a deadstock fabric emporium, which means that all of these fabrics are, like, no longer in production. They've ended up here and they will not be making any more of them. I swear I have a dress from Urban Outfitters from this fabric. This could be that fabric So if you find something that you like, grab it and run! Well... pay first. But yes, grab it, pay, and then run. So I'm gonna be meeting Stephanie here as well as Sarah, who works at Rag Finders, who's going to be helping us... Explore. Adventure. Quest. Navigate! Navigate is a good word She's gonna be helping us navigate this place. I can hear them on the, uh, on the mics. It said, "did we lose them?" A little bit. A little bit! Because it's large and labyrinthy. You could see me holding my eyeballs in my hands. I dunno. In all seriousness though, Rag Finders is super cool. And there are a lot of hidden gems there Look at this blue camo print! I could make you a pair of joggers out of that. You'll look like one of the cheetah girls. And we decided to start our expedition in the lace room upstairs. Through a crevasse! In terms of laces, we were looking for something with a semi gothic vibe without looking too tableclothy or too floral. You got to do this with all the fabric, so I can kind of see them. You can just cocoon me inside of them! So cobwebs were in. I like it cuz it's kind of spider webby. And it's pretty geometric, which I also like a lot. It's kind of wicked! But fruits were out. Yeah, you're right. And it does look like a pineapple! Pineapples just make me think of Fibonacci numbers, which makes me think of sixth-grade math. And Stephanie also wanted a fabric with some heft to it. I don't like... Yeah, no. I don't think so. It's not thick enough for me. We need a... we need a beefy fabric here! Where's the beef? And after pulling a fair amount of fabric rolls out of the depths... I don't know how to get in there... and then having to put them back where we found them... I'm like jousting! Put 'em up Ty! I'm jousting with you. We gathered a few possible lace options, and then decided to head over to another part of the store. All right. Squeeze, suck it in. squeeze it. Suck it in. A metaphor for putting on Spanx! But on our way over there, Sarah did spot one last lace. Now, our first dress fabric is a beaded scalloped pattern with ever-so-slight art deco vibes. So I had kind of been keeping half an eye out for scalloped patterns in the lace room. Wait, this one's actually awesome! This one's kind of really awesome! This is really awesome! So Sarah had done good. Good find! Sarah is the Bane of fabric stories. (in a mediocre Bane voice) I was born in the fabric store! Unfortunately though, once we pulled it out (disappointed exclamations) we realized it was too narrow of a bolt to actually cover my body, so it was a no-go. But maybe we can, like, take a little for inspo or something? Yeah! Still on the hunt, we headed downstairs. Past more mountains of fabric... To the jacquard area. To try and see if we could find anything sparkly or patterned with kind of a celestial vibe. We did end up finding one shimmery metallic fabric that could have been an option, but none of us were really feeling it. I think it's not right. Okay. There we go. I don't think so. That's why we do it! And without finding a clear front-runner... I mean it would be... RED HOT!!! Hahaha!!! We decided to say "auf wiedersehen" to Rag Finders, and head over to our second destination: Mood, of Project Runway Fame. I'm try to remember all the things that Tim Gunn says... I dunno, I think he just says "let's go to Mood!" Yeah, right?! "Alright, time to go to Mood! Thank you Mood!" Yes! Now, beyond that, Mood is more of a standard fabric store with just a wide range of options. This one's kind of funny. Not for the dress, but just in life. and so we inevitably found a lot of things that were not gonna work... With interesting patterns... Is it, like, vaguely animal print-esque? The subtlest of cheetah prints? As well as textures... Oh, there's feathers over here. Oh, there's a lot of feathers over here! But something that Mood did have a fair amount of, was good sparkly options. Oh, wow! That's really nice, actually! Now, I was down for some sparkle, but we did have to be careful with beading, because we didn't want anything that could snag in a dancing situation. Especially during this move. The Buns-A-Rollin' where Tyler spins me around on the ground. And though we did end up finding a couple of good options... It's kind of cool! Yeah, I don't foresee these falling off. Stephanie had to secretly found a treasure in the corner, that she was eager to show me. Get ready! Get ready! Get ready! I don't know if this is right, but, like, Which was a sheer black fabric with embroidered stars. Oh wow! It's pretty awesome! It's pretty awesome, right?! That is pretty sick guys. And though I had kind of given up hope of finding a celestial patterned fabric like this, it was one of the things that was all over my initial Pinterest board. And they're not like "stars" where they're like "Oh, they're stars". They're little abstracty stars. You know? It was very different from all of the other options that we had considered... This is really good! But it was light, seemed easy to dance in, and would match so many other elements of our wedding that it really felt like a winner. I mean, kind of, like, out of all the stuff that we've chosen, this is definitely you. Yeah, I think so too. I think this could be the one, honestly. I think that's also, like, the first time I've, like, felt that way. Good!!! And having checked out so many different fabrics from Velvets, to pineapples, to fire trucks, It felt kind of surreal to finally find something we liked so much. Alright, this is pretty awesome. Is that a saying? Is that a thing? No I don't think that's a thing!! So we decided to go with this one. I guess that was a resounding "Thank You Mood." "Thank you, Mood!" And with our material and our silhouette chosen, it was time to put the whole thing together and do a fitting in our final fabric. Ready? And right away we were pretty pumped with how it was looking. Love it! And with how it was twirling. No, I was ready. But, I want to see it again. Okay Now there are a couple of things in this more final version that are kind of new to the design. Oh wow! First of which is the sleeves which originally were gonna be made out of a plain black organza. But after Stephanie went home with our starry fabric and kind of hung out with it for a second, she suggested that we instead do the sleeve in our fabric, just unlined. I think it was a great decision to do the sleeves in the same fabric as the dress. We also slightly changed the opacity of the bodice to feature our stars more prominently Which actually nicely matches the Sheerness of the first dress as well. Besides those changes, I was also quite pleased with the added volume in the shoulder area. As well as the snugness on my behind. Sorry, I just, like, I panned right to your butt. Crash zoom to your booty But it wasn't so snug that we couldn't still boogie a little. Let's get your butts-a-rollin', right? Butts-a-rollin' sounds better. All of the details aside though, I think this dress was, without question, just a hundred percent, the right dress. I feel like this is so you and, you know, and, basically, we... nailed it? And I think we were all really happy with it. Completely! It's an extension of the main gown and I just think it's stunning! Yeah. Me too. Love it! Now, as you guys could probably tell over the course of this video, this dress making process took quite a while, and frankly, between this dress and our first dress, we've been working with Stephanie and Christy and all of their partners basically all year. It's been such a great experience to get to know them and work with them, And I'm so grateful that they were willing to let me be so involved in the design process. From the initial sketches, to the dungeons of Rag Finders. You guys are full Gollum right now. You're literally finding the ring of power in the darkness. I'm super excited for both of the dresses that we've made together, and I can't wait to show them to you guys in the next episode. So let's get our butts-a-rollin' and get married. Thank you guys so much for watching! And once again a huge thank you to Stephanie for making this beautiful dress! I am so excited to see how it If you liked that video make sure to sha-mash that like button and if you want to see more videos like this make sure to sha-mash that subscribe button. a big shout out to SunTheAlpacaMan, thanks for watching SunTheAlpacaMan, and I will see you guys a-next time! Hello, friends, and welcome to another video This week, we're gonna be baking a wedding cake with every possible cake flavor in it Perfect for the bride who wants it all...literally Now as some of you may know - besides being engaged, betrothed, and affianced I am also a bit of a mixing fiend, having previously mixed together many of my makeup products, hundreds of lipsticks, nail polishes and candles. So naturally, given our nuptials this fall We wanted to see if we could do a wedding themed franken-experiment. And a few months ago, one of you guys sent to me a tweet that got the hamster wheels in my mind a-whirring "A Franken cake," you say? I was intrigued. Now, a question you might have at this point is just what does it mean to make a cake with every possible flavor? Well the expected answer and how we usually do our Franken videos would be that we would mix every batter Together into one mixture and then make a single cake but following the trajectory of our pseudo science videos getting increasingly crazy and notably large- and also borrowing some inspiration from the reality TV classic, Cake Boss, we felt like we had to bake something a little more grand so we decided that for our Franken wedding cake every single flavor should get its own layer and thus the idea of a many tiered Giant cake-zilla was born. It's time for some bad culinary science, y'all! Except this time there won't be lipstick in the cake unless we Accidentally drop in some of our ColourPop Franken lipsticks, which are back in stock now at colourpop.com We've got our six colors and our full collection kits all back just in time to add a little batty cheer to your holiday Season perfect for anyone who wants some nightmare with their Christmas. Yes, it's still October in my heart No. All right! Now as for how we're gonna make this thing, one thing to keep in mind is that we're not great bakers Let alone bakers of cake monstrosity, so we're not gonna bet on this getting to our actual wedding in fact We do have a backup cake purchased but we are gonna try our best to make this bad boy as legit as possible So we've recruited our friend and baking expert Rosanna Pansino to help consult us on how on earth to make a giant cake, without it destroying itself and also us All right, so we are here at Ro's house, Ro's been briefed, you know Like the idea of the vibe. Can you help me? I hope so? I thought about it a lot in theory How one would assemble this cake? So it would be structurally sound and you could get a lot of variety. Both of those things sound good. I think structurally, Sound is something that is weighing on my mind a little bit I feel like it could easily end up like what are those ladies called the goth fairy? Godmothers from Sleeping Beauty and their cake just kind of like falls over I see that I see that happening for me now wedding cakes are traditionally made in like a tiered structure where each tier gets smaller as you go up for stability now a tier is for cake layers put together and you ice them and that's a tier and Conventionally if each layer is 1 inch tall with frosting in between them. Now. How many tiers can you make a cake? - That's the question. 
- Whoo Now obviously we want to make a cake with as many layers as possible to fit as many flavors as possible but there are a couple of things to keep in mind one is that they only make circular cake pans so big and so small So we're going to be limited by like literally what is purchasable the other? Limitation is the size of our ovens the ovens in our house are kind of small. So we're planning on renting Industrial ovens for the big boys, but even they have their limits So it seems that our largest pan size is gonna have to be 18 inches wide and the smallest 4 Technically goes to a three inch but I would stop at a four inch because a three inch cake is... A 'lil baby! - It's basically a cupcake 
- and if the size of the pans increase two inches at a time, we'll have eight tiers in total So basically we are gonna be able to have 32 different flavors Which is obviously not every flavor imaginable, but when it comes to conventional wedding cake flavors - It's a good chunk of them. 
- I got you a list of different flavors that you could pair together Thank you Now in terms of which flavors we're gonna use we have two main objectives to have as diverse of a cake as Possible looks wise and taste wise and also to pick cake types that could support layers Above and below it which unfortunately rules out like mousses, souffles Tiramisus, or flans. Great cakes, but not very stackable. To highlight the different flavors as well, we're also gonna be making corresponding frostings to go in between the layers - Whoa 
- So you have like the true Frank and cake experience and once we decorate it like a wedding cake we're gonna be tasting the cake as tiers as well as figuring out a way to taste all 32 flavors at once do you think That sounds too crazy. It's definitely an intimidating undertaking Okay, but I think after talking with ro we at least have somewhere to start? All right so after having ordered an ungodly amount of cake pans grabbing all of our ingredients and prepping some stuff We are ready for our bake-a- thon so basically today we are all hands on deck which means that I'm gonna be mixing and baking Tyler is going to be mixing and baking that's you Tyler - Oh, yeah
- and then our team member MaiLinh who has been helping us plan. This project is also going to be baking - So we're gonna be mixing and baking many cakes at the same time 
- You sound like a frog. 
- Sorry. We recently went to Vegas for our bachelor Bachelorette party so my voice may be shot - May? 
- Is. 
- Okay. There you go. 
- We've rented ovens. We've rented fridge and freezers. We went to Costco - We got like more eggs than anyone ever. It's a it's a production.
-  We're an unlicensed bakery. 
- We are super unlicensed The ovens preheated. Now some of the cakes were gonna be making from scratch but because of the sheer quantity of cakes we have to make there is some cake mix around and by some I mean a lot. Also, as we go We're gonna be adding in the extra batter into a sort of slop Cup I guess for lack of better term and we're gonna make a true Franken cupcake out of our extra batter - Yeah 
- to put on the top of our giant Franken wedding cake and that's how we're gonna taste all the flavors at once All right. Is it time should we start as for the main cake flavors, We're obviously gonna be including some of the more basic - Cake mixes like the chocolates, vanillas and funfetties of the world 
- Woohoo! Party! and we've decided to use them primarily in the bigger layers at the bottom. We do have a large - Man overboard 
- New plan! Bottom layer, plastic flavor - Now these bottom layers are gonna take a lot of ingredients 
- Open the eggs. We need the eggs bring the eggs in here! So thankfully we have this automatic mixer to do some of the heavy lifting on these big bowls of batter - All right, once everything's incorporated. I'll make it go fast. 
- You don't need to make it go too fast I like to make it go fast. And once the batters are ready We're gonna take the big ones like these down to the garage where our industrial ovens are - Oh my god, it's hot in here 
- and pour them into their appropriate pans - Which we've pre-greased and parchment papered. And then we'll put them into the oven. 
- My hands are like really really sweaty So in addition to the sort of chocolate and vanilla category, we have some other bigger layers I feel like one of the mice in Cinderella trying to build her dress. Also, with just straight-up box mix but they're a little more fun kind of with flavors like lemon, strawberry, - Pumpkin spice and good old just spice. 
- Which Spice Girl are you Ty? 
- I think I'm baby spice. 
- Oh, yeah - Which one am I? 
- I don't know. Depends what day it is And these of course are also gonna get poured into their giant pans - Oh my god guys, its Neapolitan ice cream 
- as well as stuck into the oven to the oven - Alright, watch yourself Saffy 
- To the club to the oven. Whoa - Which I think Tyler might be scared of 
- It looks like the furnace from home alone. It's got like a face. "WELCOME TO HELL" We also have some fun straight-up cake mixes in smaller pan sizes as well like angels food cake Salted caramel. Butter yellow. Cookies and cream. And red velvet. - Well, I'm talking about the cake flavor red velvet 
- Look how red - this is actually I didn't know it was that red
- but Tyler's talking about the k-pop group 
- now that is truly some red flavor and the smaller cakes in general are gonna be going in our upstairs non rental ovens These two cakes next to each other give you strong McDonald's vibes - It's like the burger patty and like what's left of Ronald McDonald 
- that makes me not want to eat it. Now our cake mixes are Mostly Betty Crocker, but we do have these two British mixes from King Arthur Flour - This is kind of like the Great British Bake Off from hell. 
- Yeah - Mary Barry wants you to bake a giant cake 
- A franken-cake! - You fools! 
- and these are like slightly more difficult mixes or at least different recipes. 
-Hello Why are you what this is? This is the recipe! Tyler just put water in and then put eggs in. Put the mix in, Ty! - It says whisk together water eggs and oil add cake mix. Stir until smooth.
- Okay. Alright fine. I believe you. It just looks very... 
- It's a British box - They drive on the other side of the road. Okay makes sense. 
- Editor's note It turns out this company is actually based in Vermont But at the time we really thought they were British besides those We also have like a large amount of cake flavors that we're making by taking plain mixes and then adding extra ingredients - Into them like cinnamon. Peanut butter. 
-That's definitely not enough. 
-That's not enough?! 
- No. 
- Oh wow 
- and peppermint extract - Oh that smells strong. That smells like the ladies locker room at a spa 
- And we're kind of just adding these in to taste - Oh, that's good. You don't need more peppermint in that 
- You can taste it? - Give it another hit. 
- Yeah, that's what I was thinking. 
- Some of these are gonna need food coloring. While others will just get their color from there extra ingredients Yeah, that looks artsy Maybe people do have matcha for their wedding cake because then you could say we're the perfect matcha We are also gonna be making cake flavors by replacing the water in the box mix recipe with different liquids like orange juice Coconut cream hot chocolate and coffee. Oh, that's what I need right now. Just a lil sniff. - Oh that was Folgers to the face 
- As well as lime juice and champagne. 
- Are you gonna shoot that off in here? - Full disclosure, I am not very good at this. 
- Oh! - Wow that was actually pretty explosive! 
- That was good! 
- I'm glad that everyone pointed me in the right direction And we're hoping that these more unique flavors like the pink champagne and the matcha - Cosmo and Wanda ain't slick! 
- will give us some serious Visual impact in the cross-section and then our final few layers are all going to be made from scratch like butterscotch Hazelnut almond. Pineapple. And Bananas Foster Okay, so many hours, boxes and ingredients later We've mixed up 32 separate batters and we've gotten them all in the oven This is taking my total cake baked number from like four to like 36 - Now cakes have also been coming out of ovens. We're not just leaving them in there. 
- Okay. 
- You got it down. You got it - Booyah! 
- and the ones coming out of our industrial ovens are looking pretty promising. Oh and then once they've cooled off enough. We're putting them in the fridge I feel like there's probably somebody outside casing our house right now and they're like, you know You understand they have like a lot of cakes - Now the upstairs oven is a little bit of a different story. 
- Oh my god Oh My god, oh my god. It's crazy over here. Oh my god. It's going crazy over here - In general? I don't think it's a great oven. 
- This is this is real. This is real This is a real problem But specifically the duo of butter yellow and mint tried to take the house down Well, it smells minty fresh - It does 
- something about the butter yellow caused it to - Overflow into the mint causing then the mint to overflow into the oven 
- the Ring of Fire Now they are baked and the house is still standing, but that ones on our list Why are you the way that you are ,cake? So now that our cakes are all baked we can move on to our - Slop cup. Which we've been adding our extra batter to all day. 
- It looks like Rachel Green's truffle 
- The trifle? 
- Yeah Ladyfingers cream then beef sauteed with peas and onions - Another round of ladyfingers 
- and we've actually filled up three full buckets as we've been baking. 
-Oh, it looks weird. 
-Oh, yeah - It looks like bacon 
- A little meaty 
- To go into our Franken cupcake batter. 
- Whoa! That was pretty gloopy. I'm not gonna lie. Oh, that one looks very appetizing actually. All right, let's blend these biatches So it actually doesn't look as - Unappetizing as I thought it would 
- No 
- I feel like most of our cakes were brown But that like red velvet cake really just asserted its dominance and made it red - It smells kind of minty 
- You did dose it with that peppermint, Saf. 
- Yeah, I mean I smell mint and like - Weirdly, maybe banana 
- and then once we've scooped it all into the cupcake pan. We'll take it down to the oven Hopefully the last thing to go into the oven ever Hopefully the last thing I ever put into an oven I'm like that baby - You know the baby I'm talking about 
- So it's about 30 minutes later and our cupcakes are ready They look awesome, It almost looks like a Venus flytrap with a tongue or like a little bit like demagorgon-y But we'll deal with these dudes later for now They go in the fridge but to finish off our night we have to level all of the cakes that we've baked and cooled so that they're all exactly one inch tall and Also flat. And our plan is to use both cake levelers, which are these kind of cheese wire type situations - Yes
- as well as knives for the cakes that are either too crumbly or too large for the Levellers And after we level them we're gonna pop the cakes out of their pans and then wrap them label them and put them into the freezer So they're easier to handle when we're building which we're gonna do tomorrow. All right So here we are on our cake building day So we're gonna start off by building each tier individually using our corresponding frosting flavors between each layer Which we've pre-made by mixing the appropriate ingredients into a vanilla or chocolate Buttercream base. And in addition to putting our frosting into piping bags We're also going to be using this fancy dancy cake turntable So I can just squeeze that bag and the cake will move underneath me. All right, let's do this So I'm gonna start with these 6-inch layer and the one that's gonna be on the bottom is orange chocolate Rosanna had recommended that we put cake boards at the bottom of all of our tiers for stability - So I'm gonna add some vanilla frosting to the bottom of the cake and then just stick it on there 
- Just as Vanilla Ice - Was a glue to the music industry in the 90s. 
- What the? Who? 
- Vanilla icing will be a glue for this? - And after that, I'm gonna put the orange frosting on top of our orange chocolate cake. 
- Oh, it's coming out Ty - and we want the frosting to be pretty thick and even 
- oh, - I'm figuring it out. 
- So it can support the layers above 
- this is actually looking kind of decent And then we just start stacking our layers. All right - Next up is banana 
- The only dynamic to be aware of is that with a four layer tier There are only like three inner frosting locations So one of the layers is gonna be flying solo like our banana cake Which is gonna have chocolate cappuccino frosting on top to go with the chocolate cappuccino cake I'm already interested by this flavor combination - Yeah
- and then we have matcha cake and frosting to round out the tier So when we spec'd out the cake We tried to like sort of distribute the flavors and colors for maximum visual diversity as well as flavor Surprise, I guess I would say and I think that this tier is definitely gonna be hitting a lot of different taste buds - It's like your coffee and your fruit in the morning. 
- Yeah, actually, that's right So we'll see if that strategy comes back to bite us when we taste it But for now, let's move on to the 8-inch cake Which is sort of like a spicy almost Valentine's Day-ish tier because we have chocolate cinnamon - Unleash the power! 
- Red velvet, devil's food and pink champagne in it. - Boo-ya
- Rock and roll man. Cake, frosting and rock and roll. Those are my three vices man All right. So that is the 8-inch tier down, now we're going for ten. Now for this tier We have salted caramel, our spawn of Satan butter yellow cake, our British But not British eggnog one and some coconut on top I feel like this one kind of looks like a filet-o-fish or like a crispy chicken sandwich - Yeah
- Besides that we actually don't have much in terms of a theme for this tier But it looks and sounds - Pretty tasty 
- That looks like the kind of cake you want to take out to a nice seafood dinner. 
- You don't even like seafood - I want to date this cake cause I'm trying to say 
- That's so rude. This is our wedding cake. All right What is this Who am I what's happening? This is the ten inch this is the 10 inch tier now We're on to the 12. So this tier is kind of like a mash-up combination of flavors You might find in a tropical climate because you have coffee beans with the mocha cak.
- Oh, shiz. Yeah, I'm good - And that's a thick one.
-  It's a thick one. Mr. Grinch. Cacao beans with the hot chocolate cake We're trying to minimize Stabbing in this video Minimize stabbing maximize flavor. Followed by a lime layer and then like a mint mojito on top This looks like a pile of toothpaste but I feel like it might taste good because it smells awesome. All right, high five I tricked him into that one So now we're on to our 14-inch tier and we are starting off with spice This tier is kind of like the Professor Utonium from Powerpuff Girls section mainly because there's a lot of spice going on on Sugar spice everything nice. These are the three ingredients to create the perfect little girl We're just missing a little Chemical X. But we do have some vanilla and some German chocolate to make up for it - How is German chocolate cake different from other a chocolate cake? 
- It has an umlaut. 
-Ah, it's chook-let It's cook. Now. I'm not gonna pretend like I've been killing it with the piping overall I'm just not like good at this and I'm getting exposed but I think my forearms are getting kind of tired - So Tyler has been helping me out with it. 
- Your hands are wild right now 
- High-five I know I got you with that earlier, but you are not getting me with that now - We've also entered the territory with these cakes. We're just moving them at all is a two-person job 
- The paper's slippery - All right, watch out for the frosting bucket. 
- Watch out for the clothing So next up we have the 16-inch layers, which I'm deeming flavors You might inject into a donut. With some richer notes like a butterscotch and Nutella and then some fruity notes like lemon frosting Which I guess we may have let saw a little too long. Oh my god. Keep going. Keep going Whoa, this is a runaway lemon. What the hell screw banana time. It's lemon time. Whoa And on top of that we have lemon cake, strawberry icing - Which is not quite as crazy as the lemon one and strawberry cake. She got hit by a giant cake! But with that one put away - It's time for the biggest boy, the 18 inch-er 
- Slide slide slide slide slide 
- You sound like Ross 
- Pivot! Pivot! Now this tier has a peanut butter cake on the bottom that has started to get a little crumbly so we're gonna be very careful and we're gonna adhere it to the cake board cracks down and then hopefully if we just kind of Move on as if nothing's happened We'll be all good. A peanut butter frosting that Tyler is going to be squeezing because he's been getting pretty good at it - I'm like entering a headspace with this. 
- Are you entering a zone? 
- Yes. 
- Is it Auto Zone? 
- Yes And then chocolate, carrot cake, and funfetti frosting and cake on top Did that work? - Uh, it's on 
- and I'm gonna say the theme of this tier is that they're all just giant. 
- All the way up - All the way up 
- Will it fit? Will it fit? Yes. Yes yes yes yes. Yeah! 
- My hands got buttery Yeah! So with all of our other tiers built and put away we're going all the way to the tippy top for the four inchers - Oh my god, it's so cute. 
-Yeah
- It's a baby shark 
- In this tier, we have cookies and cream,  pineapple cake and frosting Hazelnut almond cake and then cherry icing Which is supposed to pair with our angels food cake layer - We saved it for the top because it is very delicate and weak so we're gonna see what happened 
- Don't breathe on it - Well, sorry 
- Now with all of our tiers built it's time to frost the outside of each one individually before stacking them on top of each other and basically what we're doing is first applying a crumb coat of our frosting which is sort of like an Initial thin layer then putting them back into the freezer before adding like an exterior Final layer of frosting we have enough vanilla frosting in life. We have like a paint buckets worth - So like I hope that's enough 
- I don't know how much that is - 35 pounds?! 
- and I think I've been kind of figuring it out. 
- Okay. Does that look crazy or does it look artful? - It's kind of like rustic looking 
- That's like a wedding vibe, right? Like the barn vibe - This is the stucco facade that no one on house hunters wants 
- They want crown molding though And then once they're done, they go into the fridge for storage the only one that seems to be Presenting a problem is the tiny cake because I'm afraid that if I use my big metal scraper on it It'll just like fall over. So I've been using a piping bag But unfortunately, the frosting is kind of drooping off of it who knew that it would be the four-inch one That would be my downfall. So my new plan is to just go at it with my hands - Like what if I built it a fortress of frosting and then squished it inside? 
- We'll call it the fortress of solitude. 
- Yes I'm going to caress the frosting onto the cake. All right guys, it's time for a rebrand. We're not selling lipsticks anymore We're selling hand massaged frosting. That's my new merch item And once the frosting is on, we can try to shape it by shaving off the excess - Okay
- That's not bad 
- and then use the metal tools to you know, make it look artsy - It looks like a bandaged head. 
- I was gonna say looking the Invisible Man
- Okay So with that, we are done building and frosting all of our tiers So the only thing that's left to do is to put them all on top of each other and build our final cake Which we're gonna do tomorrow because we spent all day doing this so Good night again and see you in the morning, which is right now Now, how we stack the tiers is Actually pretty important because as Ro let us know no matter how much good - Baking we've done if we don't have the right support the cake might not survive 
- Now for structure - Let's talk structure 
- As we mentioned We have a cake board at the bottom of each tier which sneakily has like a little circle cut out at the center So what we're gonna do is use a Big Mama dowel or big stick - This is probably the most dangerous part 
- and essentially thread all the layers on to it We're also going to be using complementary smaller dowels in each individual tier - Which we're going to be measuring to the height of our tiers chopping. 
- Whoa! - I mean business 
- and then sticking in 
- and the reason you do that is because when you stack on the other layer on top the Dowels will support the cake board so that your cakes don't just kind of like squish into each other Yeah They don't end up like stacking cakes and what we found on the Internet is that you should use the diameter of the cake Divided by 2 number of dowels in each respective tier. I have like a large wad of frosting right here How did I get there? - I don't even know it's like very early on in the day. And now we do this seven more times. 
- Whoa!!! It's a minty surprise - It seems like it should get easier as you keep going because the cakes get smaller 
- ha ha ha ha ha sharkbait ooh ha ha but handling like a tower of cakes is kind of terrifying - Especially when the top layer will just not cooperate. 
- It's not heavy enough. So gravity's not like doing that much work right now Oh, no, this is your final boss, Saf I'm like lliterally screwing the top on I should have known it would come to this All right, I think that's on. It looks like a man It looks like the Michelin Man but a cone and together. It's coming in at an impressive 47 inches tall which means that the frosting is accounting for a full 15 inches of height - In fact, that might be the most impressive part. 
- It looks like the Burj Khalifa - I mean, it's basically the Burj Khalifa of cakes. 
- So it's the Burj Cake -lifa. Yeah - Nailed it in the corner. 
- Not terrible. Not the worst we still have our cupcake that needs to go on top and also some - Decorations that we bought but this is pretty close to its final form 
- Update: The top three cakes are leaning pretty heavily to the left So, um, it is living up to its inspo of the leaning sleeping beauty cake we're gonna try and make a little shim out of cake board and put it right here because it's this layer that's Like leaning them all over that actually is doing something Put a flower there. Yeah While we were stacking them we tried to put our cakes on as evenly as possible - But they're still wanting to lean. 
- All right. Now, it's this way. 
-What if we shim right here? 
- Right in the front? 
- Yeah It's like we're feeding a monster - It seems like the shims are helping but I still think we'd better add our finishing touches a fast 
- Ty you film The whole time in case it falls we need every camera on it - So we're gonna stick our Franken cupcake on top as well as a little custom cat bat cake topper. 
- He's roosting - He's looking pretty good Safiya. 
- We also ran sacked a local Joann's So we have some spooky flowers ribbons and buttons that we can stick on there as well. Oh Oh, yeah. Oh my god. It's cute as hell and with our extra decorations It's kind of giving off a sweet but ghoulish vibe, which I'm liking a lot It is even with our shims sort of continuing to lean This general direction right now. I think with all of these sort of like spooky decorations It's sort of Tim burton-esque. It is looming over The ground 
- Now we're getting pretty close to actually tasting our Franken cake and we've been coordinating with Rosanna to have her come over so we can reveal our Creation to her and she can try it with us However, we're all pretty terrified that this cake is gonna fall over before she gets here So I'm just gonna hold it just to be safe. I'm literally just babysitting this cake right now 
- 11 minutes - Ro says 
- I think this cake has made us its bitch. 
- Okay guys, Rosanna is here. 
- Hey Ro - Welcome to our clean house. 
- Oh my gosh. I'm so excited - Also nervous 
- Rosanna, I'm nervous. I'm holding this cake for dear life. 
-We've done everything we need to do with this thing So it's time to see what she thinks as our baking guru. This is our extreme h ouse makeover thing. We're...move that bus This is amazing, I see the cake plates and this is - Are you holding it together? 
- At this point, yes. My hand is really crampy, but it's here and you're here - So I'm happy. But I think to actually slice it. We're gonna have to disassemble it. 
- Yeah, yeah we're moments away from disaster Now, people actually do this with normal tiered cakes. Like you have to take it apart to eat it - So I think it's in our best interest to deconstruct it now 
- Look at all the support Nice  you guys - We did our best  
- If you didn't do support you wouldn't even a got to here 
- And once the cake is completely and safely disassembled we can actually cut some slices out of them and try them - You do have to use some muscle to cut these bad boys 
- I'm shaking I'm literally shaking 
- Her hand is shaking. Yeah - Don't scare me like that! 
- But the cross sections of the slices are coming out looking pretty bomb dot com 
- Yeah! beautiful - That looks so good 
- Except for the poor angels food cake, which seems to have gotten squished I think the angel food may have just absorbed frosting So with all of our slices sliced, it's taste test time. Taste the rainbow if you will. Now Ro actually doesn't know what's in any of these cakes - No
- So I'm interested to see what you think - the layers taste like 
- So we're gonna taste all of our tiers before we try our franken cupcake. 
- Look at this - Starting with our 18 inch hearty traditional tier. 
- Oh my god. That's amazing. It's really good - That's so good, what the hell?! 
- It's really good. 
- What do you taste? 
- I can see this is like some funfetti. 
- Don't look - Any flavors coming out at you? 
- The aftertaste is chocolate for me - I taste peanut butter, carrot only 
- Really 
- It was peanut butter. That's that's a peanut butter cake at the bottom - that's why it's so messed up because I put too much peanut butter in there 
- Regardless if this one tastes more like - 
- Chocolate or like peanut butter- It's pretty good and Tyler agrees. 
- That is awesome. You went ham with the peanut butter and Overall, a lot of the sections of the Franken cake do actually taste really good in particular the - 14-inch spice and everything nice tear is a real winner. 
- Oh my god Those are amazing - That one's so good. 
- It's kind of just like a cocktail of holiday goodness. 
- Oh, it just tastes like Christmas - It's like you just shotgun a gingerbread house. 
- Oh, yeah 
- And despite all of the headaches. It's caused me The four-inch tier is also quite nice. - That was pretty good. 
- The flavors aren't a hundred percent on the same power level as each other But what you can taste, tastes pretty good I think what I tasted was the cookies and cream and the cherry frosting actually Now, as for the rest of the tiers - There are a couple that are not bad but flavor-wise are a little uneven like our 16 inch pastry filler tear. 
- Whoa - Strawberries! Oh lemon, or is that lemon? It's not strawberry. No, it's strawberry. Lemon? 
- I agree with Ro Whoa strawberry then lemon then nothing - The 10 inch chicken sandwich looking tier is also a bit questionable. 
- Oh my what's that? 
- Okay, it's not terrible - It's weird 
- With the primary taste ending up being the caramel cake and the eggnog frosting Caramel, lots of caramel. Eggnog! - She's right. 
- Ro has had a moment of clarity. 
- She's right. 
- What?? 
- Yeah Yeah Yes. Yes star Baker What what star baker The other tier that is confusing is the six-inch fruit coffee and matcha in the morning cake Actually, it's growing on me. I actually kind of like the combo I think it started off kind of good then it got kind of bad and now it's okay - But I'm not sure that Ro likes it. 
- I was like - Orange Oh what's happening? 
- But since Tyler's on my side 
- The matcha is not bad I would actually say that was my favorite part of it I think we're out voting Ro two to one and putting it in the middle category instead of sliding it down to our third category the cacophonous flavor combinations - Unfortunately our flavors found in a tropical climate tier ended up being kind of strange 
-that one - Tastes the most like a mashup cake of all of them so far
- Okay - You broke Ro 
- Now I don't think it tastes like orange juice and toothpaste but I might just have a high mint - tolerance.I do not hate it nearly as much as Ro does. 
- I hate it.  
- Because Tyler hates it too. Maybe that's why I liked it -Now, this cake is not alone in this category 
- Saf is nopnig out right now 
- As the 8 inch - lusty tier is also not great. -The cinnamon is the primary cause of Ro's undoing 
- The aftertaste is so - Cinnamony and so like huh? But underratedly, I think the champagne flavor is the one taking it to Funkytown - So the overall taste is like a spicy jello shot. 
- I'm gonna call this cake the choker But hopefully the Franken-cupcake can wash that away. Now Ro actually doesn't know that it's a Franken-flavor So, let's see if she can give us an unbiased taste. What does it taste like? All right, Saf do you want to tell Ro? - It's impossible to guess 
- What it actually is is all of these batters mixed together. 
- Oh, shut up. 
- Yeah -Yeah, it's the Franken cupcake 
- Oh my god, it didn't actually taste bad 
- After trying it myself I think that Ro is right. It's definitely not bad. To me, it tasted like Vanilla, cinnamon, and lemon. But like a little deeper - not too sweet. And Tyler is actually a pretty big fan - Little bit of matcha 
- There is like a depth to the flavor. 
- I think it's matcha Why am I saying that like I know what I'm talking about - Yeah, Ro and I know  
- it does 
- Just as a final test We also mashed up pieces of our cake into a single spoonful or Franken bite, which Tyler tried and seemed to like I'm sensing nutmeg. Nutmeg mint - Maybe a little lemon. 
- So there you have it. It tastes like something and a hint of lemon So with a pretty definite sugar crash inbound, that is our Franken wedding cake Now I'm guessing this video is not going to end up being short, but regardless it won't actually reflect Just how many hours this cake actually took to make. I think all in it probably took about 72 waking hours of egg cracking and hand mixing Frosting and moving things in and out of industrial freezers - Did anyone see that? 
- But in the end, I think we came out with one heck of a cake I'm not sure this thing is gonna make a cameo at our wedding. Mostly because our hands have been all up in it I can't promise you I haven't touched every part of this cake So it probably wouldn't be kosher to give it to our guests But we now have frozen Franken cake and frankly ingredients for years So there will be many future sugar crashes to be had by us and our hard-working team at the hands of our creation Once again a huge. Thank you to Ro our baking sensei without whom this Franken cake would have become a Russian nesting doll and also a huge Thank you to Tyler for agreeing to get all of our cake smashing impulses out now and not on our wedding day - Alright, we're not doing that again 
- No? 
- Thank you guys so much for watching if you like that video Make sure to smash that like button and if you want to see more videos like this Make sure to smash that subscribe button. A big shout out to Rachel for watching Thanks for watching Rachel and we will see you guys next time (upbeat music) - Hello friends and
welcome to another video. Today we're going to be trying on five historical wedding dresses, because I wanna play
dress up, just a little. Now as some of you might know, I am engaged, betrothed, affianced. Am I going to say that at the beginning of every wedding related video? Probably, and Tyler and I are in the midst of planning our own wedding, which by the time this video goes up may have already happened. We're In the last couple of weeks of wedding planning over here. It's fine, I'm fine. But while we've been
planning our own wedding, the fashion history enthusiast
inside of me has become, has become more and more curious about weddings through the ages, and specifically wedding
dresses through the ages. Because everyone knows
the best part of the wedding is the dress. Sorry Tyler, the marriage
part is good too. Now people have been getting married for a very long time, since pretty much the
beginning of civilization, to consolidate resources
and secure inheritance, for love, well, mostly the
consolidate resources part, but also love, and what
people wore to their weddings throughout history has vary greatly based on cultural traditions and
changing fashion trends. Like an ancient Rome brides
used to wear yellow veils to represent white and warmth, and in medieval Europe,
blue was a popular color for wedding dresses
because of its association with purity and the Virgin Mary. I've got a lot of these
kinds of facts up my sleeve. In Tang dynasty era China, people used to wear
green to their weddings. See, I told you. So I thought it would be interesting to try on a few vintage and, or vintage replica wedding dresses.
Probably from eras a little more recent than ancient Rome. To get a peek into the wedding traditions and fashion trends of the time. Now to do this, we chose five eras that we thought had fun and different wedding dresses to try on. And just a disclaimer, because there are so many different kinds of wedding dresses out there in the world, we decided to focus on mostly
Western wedding dresses from the last 150 years. Also, because we wanted to use authentic like actually vintage wedding dresses, most of them are no longer
tennis sneaker white. In fact, they're mostly cream. Because well, they old, and to not drag these
old wedding dresses out and about Los Angeles, we decided to get a legit filming space
just to protect them. So we are here on this
white cyc in the studio. Just FYI, we're here. Now to help us achieve our historical wedding dress dreams, we recruited a couple of professionals to collaborate with us, someone to help us source the dresses. This is Olivia, who is
our costume designer. These are also some of
the dresses back here so don't look at them. It's a surprise--
- Block them out, yeah! Yes, as well as someone to help us finish off our bridal looks. And this is Cici who's
gonna be doing the hair and makeup today. There are a lot of wigs
prepped to my left. We're going to wig out. - [Tyler] Let's get wiggy with it! - That's not bad.
- Yeah. (group laughing) - I like that. And once we had everything
prepped and ready to go, it was time to get bridalfied. Our first dress took us all the way back to the late Victorian era. The 1890s to be specific for a seriously poofy
sleeved bridal moment. I right now feel a little
bit like the murderous bride at the end of Disney's Haunted Mansion. Till death do us part (laughs)! We decided to start
with the Victorian era, because it's when white became the go-to bridal color for dresses, as Queen Victoria herself set the trend by wearing white to her wedding in 1840. Now that said for the
better part of the era white fabric was still
kind of hard to come by, but by the 1890s improvements
in the textile industry had made it a little more
affordable for the general public. So, all of the dresses, besides this one are like authentic vintage
from the time period. We could not find an
1890s dress that would fit my 2010's frame, so this
dress we did construct, and we did make it a
little creamier colored rather than just like stark white, just so looked a little
closer to 125 years old. Now for this look, we
went with a full length, long-sleeved, high-necked wedding gown with a band at the waist and lacey ruff, as well as a white
bouquet with some foliage, and a long classic tulle veil. All right I think I'm
gonna de-veil myself. - [Tyler] Do you need a hand? Oh, avoid the boom mic,
avoid boom mic, and-- - Keep going. - [Tyler] Medium success. - Keep going. - [Tyler] Good thing we don't have to do this on our wedding day. - Keep going. Overall, I think this look
is actually pretty awesome. I am a big fan of interesting
and dramatic sleeves and I feel like this is
definitely one of those. - [Tyler] It looks like you're wearing pool floaties a little bit. - I feel that vibe. These giant poofy dudes
came back into fashion in the early 1890s and we're
called leg-of-mutton sleeves, which, yes, got their name from the shapely buttocks of a sheep. And were meant to be sort
of a menswear inspired look. - [Tyler] It's almost like
rendition of the travel pillow, where you just sleep on top of it. - You mean I could just
take a nap on my sleeve-- perhaps like this.
- Yeah. - I guess I could yeah. - [Tyler] Just throwing out ideas here. - No it's not the worst idea you've had. - Hammacher Schlemmer is considering it, Sharper Image is considering it. Sears said, no. The Victorian era was known for quickly and constantly changing silhouettes, but they all pretty much
had the same intended goal of showing off, just how
much fabric you could afford and making your waist look small. I am not currently wearing a corset. I am wearing Spanx, the modern corset, so that is making this dress situation probably a lot more comfortable for me. As for my makeup, well, I'm
not wearing a lot of it, which was reflective of
the Victorian perspective on makeup in general. You didn't want to look painted. You don't want to be a painted woman. - [Cici] You didn't want to look
like you're tricking anyone into thinking that you were
something that you were not. - That was the 1890s version of take her swimming on the first date. A lot of women's still
used beauty products but since buying and
applying makeup in public was a big no-no, a lot of makeup and skincare was DIY. So you have things like
homemade toner and rouge and even homemade eyebrow pencils made by burning cloves. That is on fire. - It is on fire. - Sort of like a vintage Instagram hack or a Troom Troom video. Need to fill in your eyebrows? It's not a problem anymore. The hair of the period
was sort of the opposite of the makeup, as it was very
done up and clearly effortful. Oh my word! And for ours we went with a curly style piled on top of the
head with a few tendrils cascading down the back. - [Tyler] Slight mullet
vibes at the current time. - There's nothing wrong with mullet vibes. Now just like a mullet
is business in the front and party in the back, the Victorian era was austere to begin and started getting a little
more fun near the end. In fact, the 1890s were
dubbed the gay '90s, which at the time translated to fun '90s, as the strict social
codes of the time loosened and women started doing
more things outside of home. I mean just look at how
much fun they're having. They've got like an obstacle course going. Weddings also became more fun as celebrations evolved
from somber church affairs to like actual parties that
you would have at your house, with food and games and
maybe a little dancing. I could really nail a
chicken dance in this thing. - [Tyler] You would crush it! - I'm crushing it right now, even half assedly, I'm crushing it. Probably not a chicken dance, though I can't say that for sure. Apparently throwing shoes at the newly married couple was also a fun 1890s wedding tradition, but since I didn't want to ruin my dress or get a black eye, we
stuck with some rice. - [Woman] All right grab a little more. (rice clattering) - That's what I'm talkin' about. (Tyler laughing) That was a good throw. - [Tyler] There's some in your hair. - Yeah, that's why we did this last. All right, now we're
gonna have to vacuum that, but I would say it was worth it. Now for our next look, bye! - [Tyler] See ya! - We jumped forward about 30 years. So it this is my 1920s bridal look. I thought we had to try on a '20s dress, because pretty much everything about the '20s fashion-wise and otherwise was completely new. It's by the end of the 19th century, social codes had started to loosen. By the 1920s of corset was off with the emergence of the newly
independent flapper girls, hitting the town and the speakeasies in their short hair and short hemlines. And flop or fashion, it definitely bled into bridal fashion, as you can see with my
scandalously exposed ankles. - [Tyler] It's extremely inappropriate. (woman laughing) I would have highly offended the previous version of myself, as well as my Great Gatsby
style dangly jewelry. - [Tyler] I think that the earrings make you look pretty
ready to like gallavant around Long Island Sound - [Safiya] East Egg, West Egg. - Is that what--
- Whatever egg it is. - Hard boiled egg, yeah! - Hard boiled egg. I am Safiya of hard boiled egg. Besides a shocking ankle reveal, our look included a loose
long-sleeved lacy dress. There's not a low waistline. There's no waistline. T-strap shoes, pantyhose,
a half-moon manicure, a large gathered veil
and a lacy headpiece. In general I am loving this look. I love the little hat-crown situation, and also, oh my God! - [Tyler] Veil down, veil down. - Head gear was a pretty key
element of the 1920s look, and many brides incorporated that into their wedding day. Oftentimes pairing it with very long, Juliet cap-style veils. This is like sort of an interesting mix of like a crown and like
a small '20s like hat. It's like a trident on my head. Now the clear elephant in the
room is the giant bouquet. This bouquet is so big and heavy (laughs) I don't know what to do. Oh my God, I'm nervous it's gonna like drag on the ground. 1920s' bouquets were often very large. Just need like a firm grip on it. - [Tyler] Yeah. It's pretty girthy, with cascading details like ribbons, bows and
or even more flowers. - [Tyler] It's kind of like
a ball and chain, right? - Interestingly enough, in
the 1920s engagement rings were referred to as handcuffs. - [Tyler] I will abstain from
saying anything (laughs). (Safiya hisses) No, just kidding.
- Watch it! - No, just kidding (laughs). Bank's closed. So I sort of took turns holding it and not holding it because
I wasn't quite prepared for the sheer mass of it. - [Tyler] Here we go, let's see. Oh that's weighty. That's weighty, that'll
get your forearm strong. - Yeah. - Forget the shake weight. That's all you need right there. - Now for the face, the trend in the '20s was pretty much the complete opposite of the Victorian era, as women started embracing makeup publicly for the very first time. - All the makeup was a bit rounded. The eyes were rounded. The cheeks are rounded. Even the lips were rounded
into that cupid's bow look. - The movie industry was booming. And whereas actresses had previously been considered women of ill-repute, silent movie stars were idolized and used as spokespeople
for the burgeoning makeup industry and things
like thin arched eyebrows which stars used to express
emotion without talking. Wow! - [Tyler] They're skinny. - They're skinty. And dark lipstick used
because lighter lipstick would turn out gray on screen, all became trends for
everyday women as well. My mouth shape looks so different. It's kind of tripping me out actually. And so we couldn't help trying some silent movie acting ourselves. - [Tyler] You have acid
indigestion (laughs). - It's that old-school
Pepto-Bismol commercial. - [Tyler] Yeah, no, I'm gonna
give you commercial thoughts. - [Safiya] With a variety of props-- - [Tyler] You just say 15% or
more on your car insurance. But you don't even know what a car is. - No there were cars, hey! - [Tyler] Hey wait, I can't hear you. - Oh, that's a 1920s version of shook. (Tyler laughing) Besides the makeup, bobbed hair was also a new and thoroughly modern look which many women adopted. I think what's interesting to me about the '20s in general, is how just like
everything was subversive. - [Tyler] Yeah. - It's like short hair, edgy. Wearing makeup, edgy. Showing your ankles, edgy. And following that theme
weddings also experienced a bit of a shake up as
courthouse ceremonies and elopements became more
socially acceptable choices. Another cool thing about
weddings in the 1920s, is that ladies started walking themselves down the aisle for the first time, which kind of makes sense. You need room for the bouquet. Though despite these new
casual wedding options, one has to imagine that
in the roaring '20s, there were still some raging parties. - [Tyler] Are you doing the Carlton? - The Carlton? "Am I doing the the Carlton," he asks. Though I was a little
nervous about partying with my precarious tiara. I'm almost doing like an
Irish step dance version of the Charleston where I'm like don't move the upper body. And we certainly we're not
gonna be doing the Carlton. - [Tyler] Oh, oh here it comes. And cut. - Got it. (Tyler laughs) So after exploring the '20s, our next step through history brings us to the 1940s with this jazzy knee length shoulder padded look. I feel very, like, I guess, is swanky an appropriate word? I feel really like hmm. Now, of course, in the
first half of the 1940s people around the world were greatly affected by World War Two. And wartime had some
pretty dramatic effects on marriage and weddings and fashion. I think that there was a
fair amount of variation in wedding dresses in the '40s, depending on when and where and how quickly you were getting married. There are some more full
length gowny-type situations, and then there are some
more casual wedding dresses. A lot of people were
trying to tie the knot but didn't have a lot of time or materials with unpredictable
soldiers leave schedules and rationing, or the diverting of resources to the military. So they have to make do
with what they could. For example, our dress is more of a Sunday's best courthouse
appropriate situation. I actually really love this dress. I love the shoulder pad. I love the little like, I don't even know what
this is, like apron, and the belt also is
very nice and cinchie. Shoulder pads were a common
fixture in a '40s style, mirroring menswear as
women entered the workforce to fill in for soldiers overseas. There is also a really
cool thing on my butt. What is it? It's literally a curtain for my booty. - [Tyler] Just imagine like the MGM lion just roaring right there. - Exactly.
- Yes. - Right out of my butt. (Tyler (laughing) Besides that, we also have an intricate neckline situation going on. The '40s is also when bullet bras and pointy boobed sweater
girls were in fashion. So maybe they're trying to create like a literal just pointy shelf. It's just like it's very, it's square. Aside from our dress, we also went with some pearl jewelry and also appropriate for the
'40s, half moon manicure, a small bouquet of white flowers and an elbow length triangular veil on the back of my head - 'Cause we don't got time for one of those long train veils. - Ain't nobody got time for that. - [Tyler] We gotta get to the courthouse. - Underneath the veil for my hair, we went with a sort of variation on victory rolls with a
less of a defined roll shape and more of just like
coiffed volume atop my head, with a little carnation on top. - Ooh, she's ready to rock - I'm feelin' it, I'm feelin' myself. Now, by the 1940s makeup was no longer the radical statement of a modern woman, and had become a staple of
everyday fashion and grooming, and the makeup item of
the decade was lipstick. It's so interesting how lipstick was used as a sign of patriotism. In particular, the US
government encouraged women to wear victory red lipstick to boost morale and vibrant lip colors were used to kiss letters sent to soldier sweethearts overseas. - [Cici] By the late 1940s,
90% of women used lipstick. - Interestingly enough lipstick was also one of the few items that escaped rationing
in the US during the war, unlike a lot of the other things you needed for a wedding. For instance, there wasn't a lot of silk to make wedding dresses out of, since they were using that
silk to make parachutes. This led not only to
shorter and smaller dresses, but also to more DIY or hand-me down ones. You wear your friend's
dress or your mom's dress or a dress that you already had and rationing became a big part of everyday life and culture. - [Emily] Apparently if you say, "Hi sugar, are you rationed?." It means, are you going steady? Are you dating someone? - Ooh, you know, I'm about
to be rationed for life. - [Tyler] Yeah! - You didn't like that? - [Tyler] Yeah, I liked it
(giggles), I was gonna say. - You're the one who has to like it so. Besides rationing though, it seemed like smaller dresses were also popular because they literally allowed you to be more mobile. From everything I've read it seems like there were short windows in
time when soldiers were home. So literally people
wrote that having a dress that could easily get on a bicycle to go to the courthouse
fast was imperative. Not only one weddings planned quickly, the speed of the wedding
itself was important, so your sweetheart didn't get called back to service suddenly before
the license could be signed. - [Tyler] You look ready to rock! You look like you could be a speedy bride. - I feel speedy. - [Tyler] You can just jog down aisle. - Cash me outside, how about that? I will say that this
dress is more aerodynamic than the previous two. Me on the bicycle. But although the weddings
were supposed to be fast, they were also supposed to be fun, highlighted with lots of
big band music and dancing. You see me with different hair colors like Christina Aguilera from Candyman. But unfortunately, neither Tyler nor I really know how to do the Lindy Hop. - Hi. - You're sweaty (laughs). I can smell you from here. - [Tyler] Okay, okay. (Safiya laughing) - It's okay, don't smell very good either. I've been wearing a lot
of old dresses in a row. We're just smelly, that's why we have to marry each other (laughs). Regardless of our swing dancing ability for our next outfit,
we swung into the '60s for a mini-skirted fashion
forward wedding look. There are so many things
happening right now. Number one on my mind is my giant hair, followed closely by my giant earrings, and then giant faux fur coat. 1960s fashion, including but not limited to bridal fashion, was all over the place, with many different
styles entering the mix, as well as a lot of people looking to express themselves
through their clothing. Similar to the 1920s, one of
the flagship fashion things about the '60s is the hemline, and that is that it went up. The miniskirt was a
trademark of the mod style which when it first started off, stood for fans of modernist jazz, but eventually became synonymous with modern fashionable young people of which style icon
Twiggy was the queen bee. - [Tyler] The Twiggs (laughs). - The the return of to Thiccy. Thiccy Two electric boogaloo. And the mini, as like the
silhouette of the future became so widespread that many brides in the '60s opted for
a short wedding dress to make a pretty bold fashion statement. This look in particular is inspired specifically by
Raquel Welch's wedding look, in which she wore a lacy
or crocheted mini dress and a big faux fur jacket. But besides the miniskirt, there were also a lot of other things going on with '60s bridal fashion. Now I think something
about '60s wedding dresses, was that pretty much anything went. Like colorful wedding dresses, space race inspired
looks, very floral dresses amongst many, many others, including what I can only describe as a crocheted condom. And yes, that was supposed
to be a wedding dress. You look like a little,
like this, basically, with your little head stickin' out. Now besides the mini
length of my lacy dress this look also included some blocky heels, sizable geometric dangly earrings, a small bouquet of daisies and a large cream colored fuzzy jacket. I think the faux fur jacket, besides being appropriate for a late fall wedding (snickers) is also very '60s-ish
because there was a sort of obsession--
- Affinity? - Affinity for furs because
of a few different movies including Dr. Zhivago--
- Yeah. - Zhivago.
- One of the two. - Trivago, which was a super popular movie set in early 20th century Russia. So there were a lot of furs being worn. Jacket, Zhivago, hotel, Trivago. (Tyler laughing) Is that right? Now for my face, we tried to recreate a version of Priscilla
Presley's wedding makeup look, which features an
intricate double eyeliner, cut crease situation, as well
as some big old fake flashes. Ooh, that's cool. - You have dolly eyes. - To top off our makeup look, we also added a light pink lipstick as lighter colors and even white lipstick were super-in during the time. - Frosted was very popular also. - Frosted lips, frosted
tips, just kidding. That was later. That was '90s. Now as for the other fuzzy
part of the look, my hair, we went with a long sort of bouffanted in the back situation. Oooh! (Safiya laughing) Ooh, ooh, ooh. - Priscilla is that you? - Which as you can tell, ended up very, very, teased and tall. Oh sorry.
- '60s are back y'all. (laughing together) - By Priscilla Presley,
did you mean Tracy Turnblad? (laughing together) And besides having
actual roots in reality, my hair was also giving off
some Austin Powers vibes. - [Tyler] Kinda like fembot hairstyle. (Safiya laughing) We did fail to equip my boobs with actual rocket launchers. - [Cici] I love it! - Though that's probably for the best. I like this look a lot. I don't necessarily feel like I'm wearing a wedding look but I do feel very
1960s, exceedingly 1960s. In general, I felt sort of
like a jet setting bride with my, I want to wear a miniskirt but the Pan Am jet is cold-look but Tyler thought I looked
more like a sea faring bride. - [Tyler] You look like you could be on Gilligan's Island. - What's her name, Ginger? - [Tyler] You could be Ginger, - But that's more tropical. This is more Russia. - [Tyler] So you can go
to Gilligan's Tundra. - Gilligan's Tundra. That is the sitcom that I star in, coming to YouTube Premium next fall, maybe. So for our final bridal outfit, we went with this very subtle 1980s look. Just kidding it's obviously crazy. I am so covered in beads and pearls, I don't know what to do. I'm just, it's just, it's all over me. What to react to truly?
- It's a lot. - The 1980s are a very
big decade for fashion. sorry I meant a decade
for very big fashion, as everything got larger and brighter, from hair to blazers, to eyeshadow, to dresses to well,
everything, just everything. And bridal fashion was no exception. As gowns got poofier,
rufflier and blingier. If I was wearing this on our wedding day would you still marry me? - [Tyler] Hard yes. (laughing together) Oh, I'm sorry no, hard "I do." (laughing together) - Now this look includes a colorful pink and yellow bouquet, a
giant headpiece situation that we'll talk about in a second, and a high necked, long
sleeved, beaded mermaid style, satin finished dress. It's kind of hilarious to me that all the other dresses have like aged naturally over the years, and this dress is still white! It's a lot younger than the '20s dress but I'm not sure it will ever beige. - Olivia, what do you think
this dress is made out of? - Oooh. Pastiche of polyester. - Oh pastiche of polyester, there we go. - [Tyler] It's like a Twinkie. (laughing together) It's gonna be here with the cockroaches. - This dress will outlive us all. - [Tyler] Definitely. - Now, our look was inspired
by this wedding shoot that Cindy Crawford did that blessed us with many an epic '80s
bridal fashion moment. But I think that most
1980s matrimonial style was inspired by Princess Diana. Her 1981 royal wedding garnered
750 million live viewers, and people around the world adored her ruffly wedding gown and record breaking train, even if they did take
the look and run with it, to more rhinestoned places. Something that's kind of
funny about this dress is that the sleeves are
slight leg of mutton sleeves. So there is kind of like
a return to traditional or Victorian looks
incorporated into this dress, but '80s-fied. Interestingly enough, Diana
had notably been inspired by the bridal looks of
royal family members past for her gown, so it's all
kind of coming full circle. It's the circle of sheep butt. As for my head, we ended up using my hair as a latch for the veil situation and put it up in a top
bun, no sock involved, all natural bun action. - All natural bun action. - And for the makeup, we decided to go with soft washes of color, like a violet for the eyes, smoked out eyeliner blended out contour. Yes, chisel the double-chin, yes. And sweeping pink blush,
all over the cheeks, which brings us to
what's on top of my head, which is this thing,
it's the Bret Michaels of veils, for sure. Cici constructed our
headpiece in two parts, the tulle part in the back... It's literally-- - [Cici] On top of the bun. - A giant like Christmas bow (Tyler laughing) on top of my head. And the lace headband with flowers and cascading beads in the front. - Oh my Lanta. This is amazing. Yeah, these are all made from stuff from Michael's. So, you know, get your craft on! - Every item from Michael's
hot glued together. - [Tyler] This is a Franken-Michael's. - [Safiya] Besides the head piece, the other element of the outfit that really put's over the top, is the detachable train. - [Tyler] Is the train heavy Saf? Could you make it down an aisle Safiya. - Oh no, it's actually not that heavy. It is a little bit like playing a game of snake with myself, like I don't want to step on my own train. - [Tyler] No that'd be bad. - But besides that, I feel good about it. Which ostensibly comes
off for partying purposes. Overall, though it's hard
to say with a modern eye, I do think this dress is pretty awesome. What I'll say is I'm
definitely enjoying myself wearing this, but if it looks good or not is a question that could be asked. - [Tyler] I like the pseudo bride ninja because the headband, it
looks like you could do a flying crane kick
and knock somebody out. - I see where you're going with that, but it is probably the
least stealthy outfit anyone could ever wear. I'm like a cat with a bell on its neck. You could find me, because
if it's not the rustling of the polyester that gives it away, It might be the brief electric guitar solo that plays every time
this dress enters a room. - [Tyler] All right waddle this way. That's the wedding
version of walk this way. (Safiya laughing) - So those were our wedding
dresses through history. I had a real blast putting
these looks together with the help of our
wonderful costume designer and makeup artist, and I
thought it was super-cool tracking how bridal style has evolved over nearly 150 years. In particular, I think it's interesting how things fluctuate and get recycled, like hems go up and down
and sleeves get puffed and then deflated and then reinflated, because as social decorum
and tastes change, fashion kind of does a circle. It's also interesting how certain things like veils and bouquets
are always included in bridal looks but change
in small ways over time. Overall, it's hard for me to pick just one favorite look from the bunch. Though I will say I'm
partial to the silhouette of the '40s dress and to
the veil of the '80s look. None of them will really
reflect the style of the dress that I've chosen for my wedding, but they do make me feel confident that in a 100% wedding fire drill, as in if my dress just implodes, I can throw one of these on and have a last minute themed wedding. I mean, hopefully that doesn't happen, but Tyler did say he
likes The Karate Kid veil. Thank you guys so much for

Thanks for watching Anica and I will see you guys next time! *Dope intro* Hello friends and welcome to another video! This week we're gonna be mixing up custom nail polish colors with Cristine   from Simply Nailogical. [Cristine:] Holo there,  and welcome to another video! [Saf:] For those of you who saw her "Giving Safiya Wedding Nails" video in July, this is our half of the collab. -We're a little late. 
-[Tyler:] Yea, just a little. 
- [Saf:] I'm getting paid for this right? 
- [Cristine] I promote your wedding, You promote my nail polish. [Saf:] So previously on our channel, we have gotten a lot of custom stuff, Like mixing up custom lipstick colors at the Bite Lip lab, two of which are part of our color pop collab (restock coming soon!) [Ty] Real Organic And we've also gotten custom shampoo, foundation, mascara, and clothing from this weird suit So when I saw that ORLY had opened up a custom nail polish mixing bar in LA I thought that, since Cristine was going to be dragging her FROZEN butt out of Ottawa for VidCon, we had to go together I mean we both have some experience mixing up our own cosmetic concoctions - [Cristine] Ben! Come have a sip! I made you something special Ben.
 - [Ben] No, I'm good thanks [Saf] And Cristine used to make videos about nail art - [Cristine]  This is a nail art channel in case you forgot. What the hell else would you subscribe for? So it seemed like a perfect activity for the two of us: mixing + nail polish + adult supervision (Safiya cackles) Be safe with blowtorches, kids Alright So with that to the ORLY color lab we go Or I guess we went So I made us an appointment at the ORLY mixing bar in West Hollywood In the early afternoon on a weekday just so we hopefully wouldn't disturb too many other patrons and um We're just standing behind this desk because I think the lighting is better at this angle [Cristine] Welcome [Safiya] Yeah, we're welcoming people into the store now. It's our new job. We work here now. We live here now. Because we do have a tendency to disturb the peace. Wait, am I allowed to be here? Now for context Cristine does have her own nail polish line "Holo Taco", which is what we're talking about. I guess I'm gonna be plugging a lot of things in this video, Cristine's nail polish, our Franken-Lipstick collab and ORLY is also a company that exists. This is not sponsored, but they did let us film there. 
- [Cristine] I don't work here. There's no affiliation. - [Cristine] This is not a conflict of interest is this? 
- [Safiya] You tell me, man. I think you're in charge here. - [Cristine] Oh god. 
- [Safiya] so anyway the way they make your custom nail polish at ORLY is that they have bottles filled with different colors of Polish that they squirt into a cup and stir together To whip up your shade,  from there You can make adjustments to the color as well as add any extra fixings like shimmer or pearl [Safiya] I was thinking maybe we should do one for each of us and then we should do a third color in which we just mix all of the possible colors they have - [Safiya] Together to see what happens 
- [Cristine] you can't help yourself can you? So with that plan in mind it was time for us to get our sh*t together and start a mixin' [Safiya] I'm eating my hair right now. I feel like a mess today Cristine. Will you help me make this video? [Cristine] I don't know if I'll be able to help with that [Safiya] All right, let's see what happens let's see if the professionals can help us here [Safiua] Yeah, just mix it up Cristine. I see you in my peripheral. Just get that cauldron going. 
- [Cristine] Safiya Don't make me dance alone - [Safiya] Is it this? 
See I told you we were disturbing - [Safiya] We can't use that 
- [Ty] no, we're using that 
- [Safiya] we'll be banished from the internet 
- [Ty]  how are you guys not banished from the internet - [Cristine] I don't know. S: So to start the custom color choosing Elina from the color lab introduced us to their iPad interface Which was sort of like an interpretive mood board with Artful inspo pictures to draw you in. 
- [Elina] the way works you click on any color that you like This gives us an idea what direction of the color you want to go But it's not the exact color that you're gonna get because we're gonna make some custom at the mixology bar - [Safiya] So this is more of like an emotional process. 
- [Elina] Yes. 
- [Cristine] What do you feel 
- [Safiya] exactly [Tyler] It's like a Meyers Briggs And then once you picked a jumping-off point there were a few other questions you had to answer before you could go up to the bar - [Safiya] Cristine you want to go first? You want me to go first 
- [Cristine] you go first - [Cristine] I'm gonna watch 
- [Saf] okay, so I'm gonna click night - [Cristine] Of course 
- [Saf] on brand As for what color I was actually hoping for I hadn't really gone into this with too many preconceived notions so I was just gonna let the photos speak to me. [Saf] I am intrigued by this kind of teal color - [Safiya] I guess they're calling it scaffolding teal. 
- [Tyler] Yeah scaffolding 
- [Safiya] and to be honest they were saying a lot of different things This is kind of an interesting sort of industrial Moody exposed lightbulb. The other one I like is jellyfish A lot of these things don't exactly jump to mind when I think of a cosmetics product - [Cristine] Imagine if this spoke to you. It's just a brick wall. 
- [Safiya] Well that also speaks to me. 
- [Cristine] That's what I speak to. 
- [Safiya] Yeah 
- [Cristine] most of the time But I did appreciate the creativity. 
- I think the scaffolding is really speaking to me. I'm gonna go for scaffolding I'm scaling a building with this teal after that You can pick if you want your shade to be lighter or darker and also choose your shimmers But Elina had recommended that we not add those in now, but wait until we had mixed up our color to decide What would look best with it.
- Oh crap, I have to name it. Yes, they do make you name your shade before you see it. [Tyler] That is a lot of pressure Which actually presented quite the challenge [Cristine] teal scaf? - [Saf] scaffolding saf? 
- [Cristine] Scaff teal. Scaf saf! [Saf] scaf saf. what does that sound like scab? - [Saf] Scabby teal, but we eventually hit some I wouldn't say gold 
- [Cristine] teal time [Safiya] teal time! But maybe some bronze 
- [Claire] here for the teal? - [Safiya] Here for the Teal! 
-[Cristine] I like that that's like a drama channel 
- [Safiya] here for the teal is actually quite good All right. I'm going for with "here for the teal" So with my form done it was time for Cristine to step up to the plate. - [Cristine] So Ideally, I did want to try and make a holo But apparently the ORLY color lab Doesn't currently offer holo because their custom formula isn't thick enough to support the glitter - [Cristine] So I'm gonna change my idea and I'm gonna go a little simpler. 
- [Saf] Mmm. 
- [Cristine] and I'm gonna make something for my boyfriend. 
- [Saf] awww, [Cristine] So sweet, but not really cuz I don't think he really wants me to paint his nails all the time But you know, it's the thought that counts - [Saf] No, I like that. 
- [Cristine] I saw this banana and I immediately thought of Ben Guess Ben's brand is kind of built around bananas [Cristine] Because he likes bananas [Saf] It was the angle of the banana that reminded her of Ben [Cristine] No! actually no Everyone thinks that but you're all - just there's something wrong with your mind. Okay? So Cristine went with the banana because Ben likes bananas and for no other reason - [Saf] All right, what are you gonna call it Chiquita banana? 
- [Cristine] no just Benana 
- [Safiya] just Benana, okay 
- [Cristine] Because his name is Ben [Ben] I think everyone understood that [Safiya] Because his name is Ben So after filling out our forms 
- [Cristine] first name Simply - [Saf] Last name Greatest. 
- and not reading any of the fine print 
- [Ben] make sure you're not signing away the rights to us [Ben] Like giving ORLY permission to make this nail polish for you [Cristine] Please contact my lawyer It was time for us to head to the bar where we met Emma our mixologist for the afternoon - [Safiya] All right. So, where should we begin? 
- [Emma] Well I have what's essentially a recipe for your polish on here - [Emma] So we start out with that and then I show you a swatch of it and we go from there. 
- [Cristine] So it's like Starbucks - [Cristine] I would like two pumps of this syrup 
- [Safiya] And my recipe called for a heavy dose of green a bit of blue a dash of yellow and a smidgen of white and then she whisked all of the polish together with a mini mixer to make our first iteration of "here for the teal" - [Saf] I mean that's a really pretty color I could maybe use a little more blue. 
- [Cristine] Yeah 
- [Saf] yeah I think my instinct was that I wanted more of a nighttime Scaffolding vibe. 
- [Emma Do you want it to be like a deeper teal in that case - [Emma]I would just add also a little bit of black. 
- [Cristine] You probably want that 
- [Safiya] you could add a little black - Which seemed to add the right amount of duskiness to the mixture - I think that looks good. 
-Yeah, I like that a lot. 
- Then it was time to add the shimmers - [Emma] So I probably recommend one of these three things 
- [Safiya] and Emma thought that perhaps a gold shimmer a blueish iridescent Pearly one or a blue metallic shimmer would work well with our polish - [Safiya] I think that I want the blue pearl and the blue metallic 
- [Emma] okay - [Saf] Yeah, I think that's what I want 
- [Cristine] that I love that for you - [Emma] Party. 
- [Safiya] So Emma scooped and dumped our powders in - [Cristine] I want to rub that all over me. 
- [Saf] all over your body. 
- And then once they were satisfyingly blended into our concoction Emma swatched the polish on my nail so I could see the shimmers in action - [Saf] Oh, yeah, that's what I'm talking about. I like that we went for the middle finger here. 
- [Tyler] Yeah - [Tyler] That's not bad 
- [Safiya] I was pretty pleased with the way it was looking on my nail so we will bottle yeah, let's bottle it - [ Saf] So I guess that was my polish 
- [Cristine] Look you get your own custom label 
- [Safiya] Oh, does it stay "here for the teal"? 
- [Emma] Sure does - [Emma]That's for you. 
- [Safiya} Amazing Thank you. And I think we were all here for the teal. 
- I need to like smack the camera. Here's the Teal - [Tyler] Well it is on your middle finger so it kind of works. 
- [Safiya] Aside from the now very worn out Tea jokes I also really did like the shimmery turquoise-y shade we had ended up with. 
- [Cristine] I think it's beautiful - [Cristine] Good job, I approve. 
- [Saf] Cristine approves everyone 
- [Cristine] not legally, but just really good illicitly Cristine approves [Cristine] That's nice it suits you And with that we moved on to Ben's benana 
- [Cristine] Wait, is this it this is it We're just taking the whole gonna just walk out of here Cristine, okay Cristine's recipe started out -unsurprisingly with a lot of yellow. 
- [Cristine] Oh yeah banana yeah Along with some white and a pinch of orange - [Cristine] Its like creamsicle. 
- [Tyler] Oh, that's good. 
- [Safiya] And after blending it up like a Jamba Juice smoothie. She's swatched it for further inspection I love the color But I think we need to make it more yellow and maybe If we add a little bit of like brown or maybe peach just to dull the color a little so it's less neon Yeah Yeah I think Cristine wanted more of a realistic banana color -versus like a runts banana
- [Tyler] Are we talking about a ripe banana? Or just like a...
- [Cristine]  well like a tiny bit rotten wanted it to Emma: If you wanted it to be like really a neutral yellow color. I could do like a drop of black - [Cristine] Shocking I'm curious though how that works. 
- [Safiya] So we went ahead and added in a splash of black -And then swirled it in 
- Oh 
- Oh - [Safiya} Something happened. 
- [Cristine] See now. It kind of looks dirtier this perfect. That's what I want. That's it. Yeah, that's fair - [Emma] So what are you thinking about in terms of shimmers? 
- [Cristine] What are you thinking? 
-[Saf] I'm not gonna put the montages in don't make me do it at this point is just a white screen So for Cristine's polish Emma recommended that she go for either a gold shimmer or a bronzy one - [Cristine] What if we do gold and a bit of the bronze shimmer 
- [Emma] We can do that. 
- [Cristine] Let's do it! - [Saf] A sprinkle? 
- [Cristine] Just the whole thing actually. Can't you just put the whole thing in there? - [Safiya] Ooh It was almost like changed it a little bit. 
- [Cristine] It's deepening it. I like it. It's aging the banana - [Cristine] It's now three days older. 
- [Safiya] So we had arrived at not only dirty but also aged banana Oh - [Emma] How's does that feel? 
- [Cristine] That's really nice. 
- [Emma] Yeah? Ben you'll look great - [Cristine] Ben looks great. 
- [Saf] So Ben in all of his filthy glory got bottled, labeled and delivered to his girlfriend - [Saf] Oh, it looks so cute. 
- [Cristine] They actually work together. 
- [Safiya] They do work together. 
- [Cristine] They accent each other nicely But before we could try them out we did have our third polish to make A Franken polish that consisted of all of the shades they had in their little syrup bottles and we have gotten the okay to - pump it ourselves which we're very jazzed about. 
- [Cristine] Why they trust me? I don't know. 
- [Saf] Don't ruin this for us So we were ill-advisedly allowed behind the mixing bar. I'm gonna get murdered by a tiny like a stick mixer It's fine. And because we didn't want our cup to runneth over we decided to go for a half pump of each of their shades - [Cristine] ahh! 
- [Safiya] Is that a half? 
- [Tyler] Eh, it looked about a half. 
- [Safiya] What did you scream? Cristine squawked. And so our mix-athon began. Oh, this is fun - Oh, that one was explosive. As we worked our way through the rainbow. 
- [Cristine] Oh we missed, gotta hold it in there - [Cristine] There ya go. 
- [Tyler] Okay. Got a dribbler? 
- [Safiya] Yeah, we got a dribbler there. Yes. Yes - [Safiya] My power is growing. I guess you could call us Madames Mix-a-lot. 
- [Cristine] One more [All] Oh yeah See that's marble time. So we grabbed our stick blender and went to town. Oh, yeah - [Tyler] That was good and it's the Franken-phora. 
- [Cristine] It kinda looks like your lipstick! 
- [Safiya] Oh my God, it does it looks like the Franken lipstick color Oh my god. Oh, it smells good. I mean don't breathe it in don't breathe in it I guess it's not surprising that it turned out to be this berry purple, which keeps showing up -But hey, I just like mixing stuff. 
- [Cristine] Mauve. Is that how you say it here? Mauve? Mouve? - [Safiya] Do you say it different in Canada? 
- [Cristine] "Mouve". 
- [Safiya] "mouve"? I think "mouve" is acceptable. 
- [Tyler] Yeah So once we had blended our polishes it was time to mix in every powder They had also. Alright, so we've been left to our own devices -So should we put the shimmer in? 
-Now in total ORLY has nine different shimmer powders a blue metallic. 
-Ooh - That looked like a firework! 
- As well as a pink red gold - let's go for the gold. White pearl, silver, bronze, blue pearl, and purple pearl. 
- [Cristine] ready, aim, fire! Was like a deep mixing sound "Rrraahh" - Like a cat in heat. Our formula was definitely shaping up to be on the thicker side. 
- [Cristine] Sounds like I'm at the dentist But it was looking pretty nice That looks really pretty actually it kind of like lightened the color a little bit - [Cristine] It gives it like a kind of a silvery shimmer. 
- [Safiya] Yeah, shall we fill a bottle? - So we folded our cup to make a lip. 
- Why does this make me nervous? 
- And began pouring in our Franken Polish [Tyler] Oh, well you're making it in. - Which I'd say I did a passable job at. 
- Alright. I'm in. I got a little messy around the rim, but I'm in. I feel like a baby - Please help me! 
- So then we popped on our cap. 
- How did I end up down here? What am I still doing down here? 
- And our Franken ORLY came to life - [Safiya] Look at what we made together! 
- [Cristine] It's a monster! 
- [Safiya] My thighs are working - [Saf] This is a thigh workout right now. 
- [Cristine] My knees hurt! 
- [Saf] Listen, we are three day old bananas. We can't be like this. Oh wow yeah. - Unfortunately, though we were completely stuck when it came to a name for our shade. 
- [Saf] "Mauve" 
- [Cristine] "Mauve Over" - [Cristine] "You Mauve Me"! 
- [Saf] Maybe ORLY is on to something by making you name your  shade first. 
- [Cristine] "Let's See a Mauvie" [Saf] "Let's See a Mauvie" - [Saf] "Mauver"? Like "mother"? 
- Because our ideas weren't getting any better. 
- [Saf] We're gonna think on this 
- [Cristine] "I Don't Mauve" 
- [Saf] "You Don't Mauve" like you don't know? 
- [Cristine] Yeah. It doesn't really work. All right, so we're gonna think on the name for this. Oh actually, maybe that's a good job for the audience - [Saf] Hey 
- [Tyler] Really natural. Really natural transition there So if you have any ideas for what you would name this  mauvish color? - [Safiya] Let us know. Help us. 
- [Cristine] Comment down below. 
- [Safiya] Cause we had a good time mixing it, but now we're at a loss So with our work behind the bar complete we took our three newly minted polishes to one of their tables - So Cristine could put them on me and we could see what they looked like in action. 
- [Cristine] I'm gonna paint your nails finally - [Cristine] I'm painting your nails. 
- [Safiya] but you're gonna do more of that later 
- [Cristine] Or before depending on which video went up first - Yes, it was Christine's video hers came out like three months ago. 
- [Cristine] but in real life, I have never painted your nails yet - [Saf] No. 
- [Cristine] What is wrong with us? There's something wrong with our relationship! [Safiya] There definitely - there are many things wrong with our relationship. Just schmash it again. Yep [Cristine] SCHMASH DAT  
 MOTHERF*CKING LIKE BUTTON - [Cristine] Okay, so we're gonna use the peel off base coat 
- [Saf] this is Cristine's "secret" peel off base coat - [Cristine] No, but actually 
- [Saf] oh, wow. It is literally called "Secret Peel Off Base Coat". Wow I called that This product was actually very recently released, but at the time of filming, it was a prototype. I'm the guinea pig here or More like the human, because you know cruelty free [Cristine] Yeah, we don't test on animals we test on Safiya So once the base coat was dry, it was time to apply our polishes! "Benana" first Oooh ahhh! Followed by "Here for the Teal" and then "Untitled Mauve". It's like the Untitled Goose Game, but nail polish. Oh, I love that one I mean, I like both of ours but I think I actually like our Franken one the best and even with just one coat I can see the shimmer 
- [Cristine] because [Cristine] There was a lot of shimmer relative to - [Saf] There was a lot of it and Cristine gave me a couple coats of each to get them nice and opaque - [Cristine] All right. Now all we need is a glossy taco. 
- [Saf] I wonder who has one of those? Well, not officially But there's a secret one! - This product is also already out. 
- [Cristine] It's a secret glossy taco. 
- [Safiya] It's not a secret anymore It really isn't a secret anymore. But regardless it was applied to my nails. - [Cristine] Ooh yes, she gone dry quickly 
- [Saf] and with that my tricolor custom manicure was complete - [Cristine] I like the spirit of this actually. 
- [Saf] Yeah! 
- [Cristine] In a strange way these three colors kind of worked They did sort of come together into a muted summery beach umbrella kind of way Does that make any sense? Kind of like a sparkly beach umbrella. Surprisingly, the one that seems these sparkliest to me is the middle finger closely followed by our - Franken polish and Ben, though I know there is sparkle in him is more of a cream. 
- [Cristine] He's a hidden gem. 
- [Saf] Yeah He's a diamond in the rough Personally no offense to Ben or to Tea channels I think that the star of the show was our franken polish - both because it seemed like a pretty Universally flattering shade, and also because the amount of different shimmer that's in there makes it kind of multi-dimensional feeling But I do enjoy the unique Andy Warhol vibes of the "Benana" color as well as the cool sea green Scaffolding shade which I'm actually very excited to wear. I think they look great. Actually, I'm pleased. How do you feel? [Cristine] I think they look good - [Cristine]I think I also did a good job painting them. 
- [Saf] Cristine - 
- [Cristine] Just wanted to point that out. 
- [Saf] Cristine did a great job painting them That was not the point of the video but Cristine did a good job painting them. - [Cristine] But you have to demo the product. 
- [Saf] Overall, I had a lot of fun at the color lab besides the chance to wreak small amount of havoc. Sorry - [Saf] This is your store. We should be letting you do this. 
- [Cristine] I'm just gonna go to the back [Cristine] I'm just finding your washroom I think it's a great opportunity for people to perfect their favorite nail polish shade or maybe even make a custom color to match your Favorite lipstick or phone case or cat? For example? He's like a shark! And though we sort of teased it The iPad situation was actually kind of useful because even though the images are more Philosophical it does get the creative juices flowing and help you think of colors You might not have even considered. Like I never thought I would want scaffolding on my fingers But here we are and I'm not sure that Ben ever thought that his predilection for Bananas would be immortalized as a nail polish, but here he is Thank you guys so much for watching And once again a thank you to Cristine for coming with us to make some custom nail polishes Thank you for inviting me Also a big thank you to the ORLY color lab for letting us film there and not kicking us out which they definitely could have done.

- [Saf] Yeah exactly. Yeah, that's perfect That's actually -  you've nailed it. You've absolutely nailed it. You've "nailed it" Hello friends! and welcome to another video. This week, we are going to be making a GIANT lipstick. Probably the world's largest, but this is unsanctioned by Guinness. Now, we have done a lot of bad make-up science experiments involving lipstick in the past, from mixing up custom colors, to melting my own nude lipsticks together, to fusing 600 plus lipsticks from different stores together, to see what the mid-point shades would be. And all of these experiments were born from some strange, deranged lipstick-obsessed recess of my mind. From which, another idea emerged. What would happen if we tried to make a giant monstrosity of a lipstick? I wondered. A queen bee of lip colors. A mind flare of pigments We had already made a small army of "Franken-lipsticks", but that army was missing a leader. But though, our desire to create a giant lipstick was strong and burning, once we sat down and tried to actually figure it out, the logistics of the experiment seemed, probably, impossible. At least without serious professional help. However, by happy coincidence, just as all hope was lost, ColourPop reached out to us about the possibility of doing a lipstick collaboration and when the topic of "What should we do for marketing came up?" we said, "How about a giant lipstick tube?" and surprisingly and probably ill-advisedly... they said yes. now, since our entire marketing budget went to making a giant lipstick, let's talk about the collab really quick. I've always wanted to produce, like, actual not kitchen-made versions of our "Franken-lipsticks" and other colors we've mixed along the way. So, when ColourPop reached out to us,  I knew right away that I wanted to do a "Franken-Beauty" collab. Our collection has six lipstick shades inspired by colors you've seen before in our videos before. The greige-y brown Mrs. Norris. The deep burgundy, Screamer. The sharky teal, Brucy. Our OG Franken-nude, Bikini Bottom. Fred the Franken-red (Fred for short) and of course, the infamous mega Franken-shade: Berry Me In Lipsticks. You guys should check 'em out! There's little bats on them. It's pretty cute and spoopy. 
Do people still say that? Okay, so with that, on to the giant lipstick. Now coming into this, my wish list for an enormous lipstick was twofold: Firstly, I wanted it to be at least my size when fully erect that's approximately 5 feet 9 inches, so I could just walk right up to it and rub my face on it and secondly, I wanted it to be able to twist up and down in some fashion. Currently, there are a few other contenders for the world's largest lipstick, but they don't meet this spec. There is a giant lipstick shaped sculpture made out of lipstick tubes, but it's more like a photo mosaic than a functional lipstick. There's also an art piece that is, like, a cubic meter of lipstick on a concrete slab. And though mass-wise it is a very heavy chonk of lipstick, It neither looks like a lipstick tube, nor does it do any of the things that a lipstick tube does. I mean it's basically a candle. So it seems that a giant lipstick of the variety that I want does not exist. We've identified a niche in the market. So to realize our vision, ColourPop assembled a team of seasoned pros to help us pull this thing off. Alright, so we are at the ColourPop office today with Dave the engineer here at Colourpop, the headhead of engineering? Director of engineering!
 - [Dave] Director of engineering. There we go! (Saf laughing) And with Keith and Sydney who are production designers who are going to be helping us with this project. So, you guys know what we want to do. -[Keith] Yeah.
 -You've heard it and you're still here, so that's good. [Keith] Yeah. Dave, as the engineer, was gonna be in charge of molding and placing the actual piece of lipstick-- or the crayon-- into our giant tube and Keith and Sydney had been tasked with building the pieces of our lipstick tube, or component. So 5'9" that's 69 inches. The lipstick that we sell now is 3 inches tall, so we've got a little bit of scaling to do. - [Saf] A Little bit. Our general plan was to take the proportions of a normal ColourPop lipstick, specifically one of our collab shades: 'Berry me in Lipsticks' and then scale it up, like, 20 to 25 times. So the tube would be about five feet tall with the cap on, but then when fully extended with the lipstick out, the whole structure would be, like, six foot four. - [Saf] That's definitely taller than me
 -[Dave] Now that's considerably taller than you - [Tyler] You might have to get onto, like, a little stepladder to actually use it on your lips, Saf. -[Keith] Are you gonna use it? - [Saf] Of course! -[Saf] I think we all have to. Of course, having a lipstick that large presents many issues, one of the main ones being the weight of all of the pieces. -[Dave] We're looking at about an 80 pound chunk of lipstick. -[Dave] We don't know. So Dave's plan was to make our giant crayon with a metal core inside of it, which would hopefully help support the large amount of lipstick, speed up the cooling time and also allow us to bolt it directly into the contraption that Keith and Sydney would be building. Besides the core pin, ColourPop was also gonna have to make us a giant custom mold specifically for our crayon. It's gonna be And Dave's ideal scenario was that we would shape and chill our bullet inside the mold, and then place the entire thing on top of our base. Then we'll pull the two halves apart, leaving the crayon standing and we'll-
Saf: oh... voilà. -[Dave] We will, we'll have to do that, um It all sounded like pretty standard makeup science until the word "crane." I was like uh...can I drive it? No. -[Dave] Yes But we did say we wanted to up the ante. As for the casing of the lipstick, Keith and Sydney had some thoughts. It seemed like they were confident about how to make the tube itself, which they were going to build with 3 giant cardboard cylinders that could stack inside of each other. I'm, like, very impressed by the girth of this thing. To represent the base, the inner tube, and the cap. Effectively, this is what it'll look like closed, and then imagine, you know, the lipstick will end up being, well, 26 inches higher than this inside piece, so... - [Tyler] Oh my god.
- And we were gonna cover all three pieces-- (Something crashes.) Ooo! 
[Keith] A calamity clam! --with flexible sheets of aluminum. I'm, like, very jazzed. 
- [Keith] Cool. I'm jazzed is the word. The word is jazzed. But the part that Keith and Sydney were nervous about was the mechanism. Now, with a normal lipstick tube, there is an inner cup that contains the actual lipstick and when you twist the outside of the tube, that inner cup rises up and down on a set of spiraling tracks. And that works great for a three inch tall lipstick, but not necessarily for our monstrosity. First off, because of the weight of the crayon, the inner cup might just spiral back down and not be able to stay erect; and hand-in-hand with that, twisting the outside of the tube would be very difficult because of how heavy and large the components would be. Besides all that, we would have to order custom giant metal tracks and if they didn't fit a hundred percent perfectly, the mechanism wouldn't even work. But Keith and Sydney had a plan. - [Keith] So instead of, like, creating that whole scenario, what we decided to do was Saf: Oh, so it just goes straight up? - [Keith] Well, it's gonna be-- yes, no, Saf: Just... (fwip) -[Keith] Yeah, yeah. So, we added Saf: So it's gonna be like a giant, robotic lipstick basically. 
- [Sydney] Yeah
- Yeah. -[Keith] Basically.
-Basically. and to hide the lift and the turntable, Keith and Sydney were gonna be building a stage for the lipstick to stand on, and all of the machinery would be hiding under there. Saf: Ooh! Oh my god, that's me! Saf: Yeah. So basically, we had a lot of elements at play, and many things to get before our building day, but I had faith in our squad. All right, go team. -[Keith] Let's roll out.
- Keith's sunglasses are everything. - [Keith] I'm gonna have my guys work on it, I dunno if there's time but uhh... we'll figure it out y'know... (Saf laughing) -[Keith] Cut! Cut! Cut! And a few weeks and a couple meetings later, That's thethe pedestal. It was time to build the damn thing. Saf: Alright, So here we are, back at ColourPop, ready to build. ColourPop has a pretty big campus with a fair amount offor lack of a better word random warehouses, so just so we would not disturb any actual makeup production, Saf: Woo! and also so we could have the run of the place to ourselves, we set up camp in this mostly empty one. Dave is going to be leading the lipstick crayon team, basically, and he is gonna start off by cleaning and lubing the mold. That's his words not mine. *laughter* And then Keith and Sydney are gonna start loading in the pieces of the tube, the pieces of the platform, the pieces of the scissor  lift, and we're gonna start constructing that as well. [K & Syd: Yeah.] -Awesome! Alright, shall we? 
-[Dave] Ready.
- [Keith] Let's do it! All right, I'm just gonna insert myself into every situation here. In general, tasks were gonna be happening simultaneously throughout the day, but our first priority was to get our lipstick bullets started, because it was gonna need a fair amount of time to solidify, and as we mentioned: prepping the mold was task number one. Saf: How do we lube? -[Dave] Well first we're gonna clean, and then we're gonna use some, uh, food grade silicone. Saf: Food grade silicone. To lube. Ow. That hurts. [Tyler] You look so devious with the latex gloves and like, the lab coat. (Tyler laughs) Saf: So team crayon leapt into action -[Dave] shoot away, Tony 
- and sprayed down our mold with alcohol. Saf: Mmm The funny thing is I didn't like, recognize it as a lipstick mold until I just looked at it right now. I was like, "Oh, yeah, I see it!" -[Tyler] We have one of these at home. -[Saf] We have one of these. - [Dave] Alright, that constitutes the cleaning part. Now comes the lubing part. -[Saf] Now comes the lubing part! Which we did so that the lipstick didn't stick to the insides of the metal casing, and once it was greased, it was time to put the pieces of the mold together. -[Saf] Do you need me? (Saf laughing) A resounding no. Surprisingly, the team of professionals did not want me to handle heavy objects, but they did hand me a drill so I could help fasten the mold together. Alright Ty, you want to see me screw this thing? [drilling] Wooh! Alright, that's it! Now, I think this is as good a time as any to provide a brief safety disclaimer. Obviously, I'm not being perfectly safe in this experiment, so in general, do not use me as a template as to how to use tools or what you should wear around tools. I'm coming for you. Are you ready for me? Overall, this is more of a mad science fair project than actual makeup production, and it does not reflect how ColourPop usually manufactures their products in any way. Awesome! [turns on drill] Alright, someone take this away from me before I do something bad. But nonetheless we did successfully piece together the mold. Oh Ty look! That looks like a lipstick! You can see the slant for the, uhh- lip application. And once we had our casing assembled it was time to lower in our metal core pin, which we were gonna pour the lipstick around. -Yeah, this is looking pretty military-grade guys
- and we wrenched it into place -[Tyler] It's like extreme IKEA
  - just so it wouldn't rattle around in there. 
-So we have the mold constructed, basically. We have the core part in also. Now we're gonna heat it up and then we're gonna pour the lipstick in. I'm pretty sure. Do I sound sure? I'm pretty sure -Then, against all reason and judgement, I was handed one of my favorite things in the world. 
-[Dave] Hold on (Saf: Oh, my god!) A blowtorch. I guess it's just a rule of the universe: where there is bad makeup science, there must be blowtorch. Saf: Oh, all right So basically, Dave and I were gonna use our blow torches to heat up the mold from opposite sides. (Dave laughs) With the idea that if the mold is hot when the lipstick is added, you'll end up with a more uniform surface on the crayon, because the lipstick won't solidify immediately as it goes in. And our goal was to get it to 110 degrees Fahrenheit for optimal lipstick pouring conditions. Unfortunately, though I feel like we were torching it pretty hard, the mold was not getting or staying hot enough. Am I doing it bad? -It's just too big to keep hot. Is that the problem? 
-[Dave] Part of it, yeah.
- Oh no. Ideally, Dave had wanted to heat the mold from the bottom as well, but we were all afraid that the mold would literally crush any hot plate we tried to put it on. But it was seeming like we had no other option. Oh, my sideburns are out. They get- they get excited by blow torches. So we decided to delicately dangle the mold above the hot plate with the help of the forklift that Dave had brought into the warehouse which, amazingly, worked. And then finally, after roasting it from every angle, our mold started gettin' real hot. (Saf laughing) Dave was not talking about beauty guru gossip, but our giant kettles of molten lipstick that we were almost ready to pour in So I continued torchin' while team crayon brought over the cauldron, and then it was time to pour. D: Here it comes! Oh, sorry! [mild panic] [worker: Woah, woah, woah, woah] [D: Okay. Watch yourself, watch yourself, watch yourself] It smells amazing! Now I've poured a fair amount of lipstick in my day, but nothing could have prepared me for this. Sounds like a pool drain, doesn't it? [T: Yeah] It sounds like we're filling up a pool. Is this helping? Am I doing this right? Our one vat only filled up our mold like three-quarters of the way. -[Dave] Oh wow, we got a long way to go. So we had to put away our first kettle and go get another one. *loud crash* -[Dave] It's down.
- Don't worry, nothing broke. -Are you guys okay?
-[Dave] Yeah.
- Alright, we're all good. That was just the kettle snapping back into place. She snapped. Saf: It is So we poured in our second kettle and as the tide rose, I started getting berry excited. -[Dave] Okay, we're getting close we're getting close. Slow down. -[Dave] Slow down.
- Yeah, I hear it. Oh, wow. And after topping it off just a hair, our lipstick was in. (Saf gasping)
-[Dave] Alright. 
-That's so cool. What a quantity of lipstick. Dave, how do you feel? How do you feel Dave? -[Dave] Uh, gosh, I think I'm pretty happy, actually.
- That's great! So we trimmed off some of the excess with a spatula. Saf: See this is, um.. the real version of the Rosanna Pansino frosting spreader that I usually use. And then cleaned up the outside of the mold before we let it cool. Alright. I have successfully smeared lipstick all over it; Is that- is that what we wanted me to do? Oh. And lipstick on the forehead. There - that's what I like - well, I'm not seeing it but that's what I like to hear. And to help it harden, we were gonna be using a chilling table. -That might be it. 
-[Dave] There it is.
-There it is. -[Dave] Speak of the devil, the cooling table appears. And our next big challenge was to get the giant metal mold on top of the cooling table. Put Tyler's face on it. Which required chaining it back onto the forklift and raising that sucker up high enough to stand upright. We let it cool like this for a while and then used the forklift once again to help lower the mold onto its side [Dave] Perfect. Perfect... Down... Alright! [clapping] And even though it had been chilling for a little bit, it was actually still pretty warm, especially inside of the core pin. [Dave] Holy cow, yeah! Feel that? Clearly it had a fair amount of cooling left to do. So we left it for a bit to check in with Team Tube [Sydney] People to help lift this thing over this. Great! I'm so pleased that I showed up at this moment. And they put me to work right away. Saf: Oo! [Sydney] Yes, you're definitely involved. Handing me a myriad of power tools This looks serious! I was just handed a saw That was a choice. And descending me inside of the platform to help adjust the lift. I'm coming in. 
-[Sydney] Alright We're- we'll cut that part [laughter] Specifically, they needed me to pass some cords in and out so we could plug in the lift. (This is my new house) And to make sure it worked, I gave my body to science - -[Sydnet] No, it's not gonna go horribly
- and acted as the first human test subject of the lift. It was one small step for me, one giant leap for lipstick kind. [Keith] Um, okay, stop. Cool. So I went back into my cave to finish off a few other tasks. -[Saf] Goodbye 
-[Sydney] Alright And once they had closed me in, [evil laughter from inside the table] they loaded the turntable onto the lift, [Saf, from inside table] Down below. It's me down below. as well as the pipe that the bottom of our crayon would lock into, and then they lowered it all down to me in the dugout. [clang] Saf: Oh! so I could plug her in. After that I begrudgingly left my den so we could prep the tube to put onto the platform. -That's all I need to do. Are we sure? 
-[Keith] Yeah 
-No more tasks in here in the dungeon? All right. I'll get out. Because next up we had to add the Franken-branding on to the pieces of our tube so it matched the normal sized ones. Using these giant peel-off stickers of my name, (Oo! that's pretty cool) and also of the large flock of bats that populate our lipstick cap. And, once we had straightened out our winged colony, it was time to put all of the pieces together. Starting with plopping a podium on the stage. Look at that - We built it a podium. that was going to hold the base of our lipstick tube in place, which went on next. I feel like I'm a high school boy polishing my car. After that, we screwed on a wooden mount to the bottom of our crayon, which would hopefully puzzle-piece into the pipe that was currently sticking out of our base. Saf: So now this... goes in there, too. [Off camera: Right.] Then came the daunting task of lifting the entire mold situation - -[Keith] How heavy is the mold?
-[Dave] About 200 pounds. - high enough so that it could be placed delicately onto the pipe. [Dave] All right, all right. All right. And this was the forklift's true moment to shine. Oh my God. [D: It's a fair amount of potential energy right there.] Whoa! It's gettin' so high! And then it was all hands on deck for Team Crayon to help ease the wooden mount into place. [Dave] Okay, you're looking good. It's tilting in. All right. All right. All right. And once it was on we had to strip off the extremely heavy metal casing like a banana peel. [Dave] All right. Now we want to unbolt our two halves guys. All right, here comes the last one.... Oh, there it goes. Okay. And this is when our butts really started sweating. [Dave] Ohhhhh.. [nervous exclamations] 
[Dave] Okay, you're free Tommy. The main concern at this point was that we didn't want the mold to swing back into the lipstick crayon and completely destroy all of our hard work. So we had to very carefully take one half of the mold off of its chains and delicately bring it down But once it was off, our giant crayon finally showed its face. Saf: Yoooo... (Saf: That's wild) And I gotta say it was a frickin' ginormous lipstick. It was quite the sight to behold. Almost like the velociraptor hatching scene in Jurassic Park. It was magnificent. From there, we took the other half of the mold off with the forklift. [D: There you go... You're free] And just like in Jurassic Park, things quickly started to go awry. [Dave] Okay, we are definitely leaning guys. We're definitely leaning. Mainly, as we tried to lower the lipstick further into the tube - - [Keith] Okay, we're going down.
- the surface of our beautiful crayon started to crack. [Dave] It's kind of like a chocolate bunny - like a hollow chocolate bunny. I think from a combination of the weight of the lipstick pressing against the core pin, as well as the rapid temperature change from when the mold was removed So speed was the name of the game for the next couple of minutes. Everyone was pretty nervous that it was moments from full implosion.
- [Keith] I was like "IT'S OVER!" So to get to the finish line before utter disaster, we gently placed the inner tube over the crayon.
- [Dave] Oh, God. -[Dave] Sorry, I just- I looked up and there it was 
-[Tony] Oh, shoot. And then once it was all put together I gave Tyler back the camera and hopped on stage so I could try to massage our lipstick back to life. Saf: I feel like we can just shmooth it a little bit It starts looking a little nicer and I think some combination of the warmth of my hands and the semi-molten lipstick I had been given to act as a mortar was kind of working. Saf: Kind of like the ramen hack for your kitchen, but in this case it's.. lipstick on a giant lipstick And although I couldn't fully fix all of the cracks, it was looking enough better that we figured we should film it now or forever hold our peace. You know, in case it fell to pieces. Saf: Alright, so this is definitely the largest lipstick I've ever seen. I mean, if it isn't the tallest lipstick in the world then I'll eat my hat or this entire lipstick. And since we had a few things we wanted to do with our lipstick, we had to move quickly. Alright, so I think we should apply this thing to my face, right? I'm a little nervous to mount it and like get in there, but I did originally want to just kind of like put my mouth right on it. You know what I'm saying? My lips - No, I didn't wanna french it. Okay, I'm not an animal. I was a bit nervous to step up onto the podium - - but my dream was to put my face on its face, -so I had to be bold. 
-[Keith] Have no fear.
- Oh my god. Have no fear, the giant lipstick is here. I know I'm like leaning in for the kiss. What I will say about trying to apply giant lipstick is that it's not really the right shape for anyone's mouth except for maybe Heidi Klum from Ella Enchanted. - But I felt like going for a corner of the tip would give me the best shot 
-[Tyler] Wow!
- [Keith] Honestly? [Keith] Honestly! It's on my teeth. I can feel it. But besides that I'm feeling pretty good about that. Oh, and I I think I smoothed out a little crack there. I think I've discovered a secret talent: applying giant lipstick. Oh, wow, not a half-bad application to be honest. Try and fix the Cupid's bow a little bit. It's a little wonky but it looks pretty nice. No, there was no tongue action whatsoever. Okay. It was just like a Dementor. After getting a few posing shots of me and the lipstick - (It's like a.. my-size Barbie, but it's lipstick.) - it seemed like it wasn't really continuing to crack. So we felt comfortable enough to try and twist it up using our machinery. [Keith] Let 'er rip! With me holding its waist as it rose into the air in case anything fell off. It looks like a ballerina.
- [Tyler] It's amazing - Yeah? And we were all amazed to see that even with some fractures, our lipstick was stayin' alive. 
-[Keith] She's cute -[Sydney] She is cute.
- Now once I felt more confident with touching and posing next to the tube our lipstick human buddy cop comedy Started turning into more of a rom-com or maybe even something raunchier. -I'm going like under under the lid right now. You see this? 
-[Tyler] You're getting a little inappropriate.
-Yeah, this is a little inappropriate (laughter) I'm really just fondling is the- is the word to use [Keith] Yeah So to get me away from the lipstick for a second it was time for everyone else to get a chance to put it on and try it out. Saf: Oh! You know what, that looks pretty precise from here. It's pretty creamy. I've been massaging it for awhile. So it's nice and warmed up. *laughing* Like the Color Pop team, our wonderful production designers and also our editors, who were on set with us. A little on the chin but otherwise lookin' good. (Saf laughing) Yes, Emily, yes! See, the color looks good on anyone. And everyone. Could be yours. And I will say it's not necessarily the most sanitary of makeup products, so germaphobes look away, but it is very fun. Like a Vanity Fair spread. Vanity Fair, but make it sweaty. So after a while of messing around with our giant lipstick and it still being here, we were feeling bolder than ever. Now when we had first put everything together, we had sacrificed some of our original plan because of how nervous we were. [Dave] Oh sh*t But at this point we felt confident adding all of the bells and whistles like boosting the height of the base up a little bit, which would hopefully enable us to get the crayon far enough inside it to put the cap on. This is what we wanted to do originally, so I'm very excited about it, but there is a small chance that the cap is smushing the tip of the lipstick. We're all about to find out. So we attempted to showcase the full functionality of our lipstick with the cap coming off - [Saf gasps] -It's fine! Alright, here we go.
- [Keith] Let 'er rip!
 - and then a twist up with the added height. (Ooo. The claw.) And I gotta say it was beautiful. (That's perfect. Pretty legit looking, in my opinion.) It was definitely more of a Monet. Like better looking from far away. There are a lot of finger prints on it and a lot of, uh, lip prints on it But sort of like the Liberty Bell, the Venus de Milo, and the giant Sphinx's schnoz the cracks almost showed what a masterpiece it truly was and all of the trouble it had gone through to finally reach its highest height. Okay, so, uh - That is a lot of things to do with a giant lipstick. Overall, I'm very pleased with how this lipstick turned out - from the batty design, to the twisting up and down, to the faceplant application and though there were some emotional highs and lows and about 10 minutes there where it seemed like the whole thing was just going to epically fail I did, in the end, get to fulfill my dream of taking an awkward prom photo with a six-foot-tall lipstick. I will say it was also kind of spectacular to see how a team of professionals would approach this project and take our bad makeup science to the next level. Besides that, it was kind of a trip to see our Franken- lipstick color that we made in a gumbo pot in our kitchen more than a year ago presented in such a huge and magnificent way. And, once again, not to be cheesy; This shade and these five others could be yours to own if you click the link in the description below. Besides the 'Berry Me In Lipstick' shade, which you've seen enormous quantities of today, we have our whole family of Franken-lipsticks; 'Mrs. Norris,' 'Screamer,' 'Brucie,' 'Bikini Bottom,' and 'Fred the Frankenred.' Don't worry, you won't be getting any of the stuff I groped, but it will be this color. A truly ginormous, Kraken-sized 'thank you' to everyone who made this possible, like the entire team at ColourPop and our squad of production designers. [K: Did we do it?] I think so. [high-fiving] Yeah! [T: For Dave!] And yes, pour one out for Dave who had to leave after normal business hours but was still an integral part in making this all come together. Also another 'thank you' to ColourPop for agreeing to this insane idea. My personal philosophy is that makeup should be about experimenting and having fun and they were really down with that which was pretty cool. As for what we're going to do with the giant lipstick, we are still figuring that out. But right now ColourPop just has a giant lipstick on their premises, which I'm sure they're jazzed about.
