 hello friends and welcome to another video today im gonna be following a cupcake soap art tutorial and attempting to make my own deliciouslooking soap cupcakes they do look good enough to eat but you really really should not 
now as some of you may know i am a big fan of fancy soaps and schmancy bath products whether that entails actually using them or smelling them or just circling them like a shark watching their every move i mean looking at them i like looking at them so much so that last year i actually tried following a youtube soap art tutorial to try and learn how to make my own loaf of snazzy swirly soap   youve been sweating   sweating out of my eyeballs  with overall mediocre results though it certainly was fun to try  ooh theres some pattern in there thats something  and since that experiment while conducting my normal soapwatching routine ive encountered an entire subcategory of sexy suds that really buttered my muffin soaps that look like desserts like pies milkshakes donuts cookies and of course cupcakes  i want to go to there voiceover saf yes that is soap not food i know it looks tasty as hell but it is not food  fish are friends not food  so fueled by a deep desire to eat soap i mean get a hold of this stuff i mean pretty i decided to try and follow a cupcake soap art tutorial and attempt to make my very own batch of bewitching bath treats from scratch i dont know about you but im aroused now as for what tutorial were gonna be following i of course am still a beginner so im gonna need some stepbystep instructions especially since it seems like were dealing with some kind of soapculinary magic here  this is not our first rodeo but it is our second  so today we are once again gonna be turning to the soap queen herself annemarie  hi im annemarie from brambleberrycom and soapqueencom  whose tutorial for hanger swirl soap we followed in our last video and luckily for us annemarie does have a sparkling champagne soap cupcake tutorial on her channel that seems pretty close to what were trying to achieve  today im gonna show you how to make these super sparkly soap cupcakes  as well as all of the ingredients and tools you will need to follow it for sale on her website  shes basically like the comcast of soap making  what do you mean she she puts the wires in the ground and she also owns nbc  yes  okay vertical integration at its finest  shes the soap queen thats why they call her that voiceover saf shes got the book the blog the berry and shes getting that bag  annemarie is a saucy minx she is and she knows it  so after buying all of this  no this video is surprisingly not sponsored  and watching her tutorial several times were gonna try and tackle it today now before we go any further i just want to say that in case this video sparks your interest and you decide you also want to follow a soap art tutorial a quick warning cold process soap like this is made by a chemical reaction called saponification which occurs when you combine oils with sodium hydroxide lye so all of this cute soap you see here is at its core made by combining an oil mixture with lye water like this is made of oils and lye that is made of oils and lye and yes that is also made of oils and lye and fun surprise by itself lye can be pretty darn dangerous like it can burn your skin it can get really hot and erupt out of its container and it can even explode if exposed to the wrong thing so if youre gonna try something like this at home youre gonna want to be very very careful with it they say to keep kids and pets away from it and definitely do not get it in your eyes or eat it so on that very positive note lets try it   alright so we are here in our kitchen with all of our soap making items set up ready to try and make some cupcakes so annemaries tutorial has basically like three separate sections video saf she makes the base of her cupcake as like a traditional cold process soap thing  loaf  block then she makes these soap frosting separately and then also the pink embed that goes on the top separately now one dynamic with this tutorial is that unlike the last tutorial we tried which was kind of like a oneanddone like a youcanfollowtheentiretutorialfromstarttofinishinonesitting situation this tutorial has a little more like prep involved so were gonna have to tackle this cupcake over the course of two separate soaping days and just to complicate things further i did also decide to change some of the colors and decorative elements of the cupcake recipe just to try and personalize them a little bit i was thinking you know it would be fun to turn annemaries glittery champagne cupcakes into like a bat cupcake for kind of like a nocturnal cupcakeofthenight vibe but we will explain everything i changed and also what is happening on which soaping day as we go so lets just jump right into it and make some poison cupcakes  before getting started with our soapy cupcakes we need to do a little bit of prep  so basically what annemarie does on day one is that she makes the little embeds that go on top of her cupcakes and she also makes her oil mixture and lye water for her frosting in advance and first up on the todo list  we have to make that pink embed  so basically ann marie uses melt and pour soap for her embeds which is essentially like the nondangerous soap making stuff  its a fiveminute craft soap  basically she takes blocks of soap that have already been through the saponification process kinda chops them up into little bits melts them down puts some pigments in and then pours them into her molds to make embeds so thats what were gonna do  starting by slicing up four ounces of melt and pour soap base  all right i think i just like do this kind of gasps honestly cutting soap is the best i dont know why its like ruffles patterned i think its just for fun  they got ridges  melt and pour soap its got ridges man  and then once we have all of that chopped up  all right bloop  we gotta blast it in the microwave  it doesnt take long to melt so make sure youre melting on  to  second bursts  sorry if our microwaves gross  is it gross  its a little gross  hello   seconds here we go  smells like tortillas over here  it does  its making me hungry  and once its all liquefied  ooh its uh melty  were ready to add in our colorants and pour the mixture into our molds  now um this seemed like a sort of area in which i could have some creative freedom add some customization to our cupcakes so i really went rogue here and got completely different embeds from annemarie i just went ham on etsy and i just did my own thing so i got a bunch of like bat molds and like star and moon molds i also changed the color of the embeds instead of going for pink i went for gray and stormy blue  so basically this cupcake is gonna be like if you had a sprinkles collab  yes  so weve gotta plop our micas into our melt and pour base and really just mix them in there stir up some trouble  oh yeah  now im noticing a few clumps so just do a quick spritz of rubbing alcohol and poof those little mica bubbles burst  see those are those bubbles that annmarie was talking about watchaaa  four times four times
  and they burst four times 
tyler four times  oh okay two three four  oof im getting a contact drunk from that  yeah  alright lets keep going  and next its time to pour  alright are you are you are you ready for my jelly  yes  i dont think you are oh sht im really nervous ohhhhhhh  oh yeah  bat now for this step im not really gonna worry about like sort of neatly pouring because i figure like we can always use like a little like um razor or exacto knife to cut off any excess in case we have some pourover so im gonna worry about filling them thats the vibe ohh see thats what im saying  if they get a little overfilled im just gonna live with it fck oh my god okay never mind thats a lot overfilled  yeah thats a thats a little more than usual  im trying my best  were not gonna blame it on you were gonna blame it on the aaaaaaalcohol right   sorry im blackout right now what whats going on all right so i have poured my meltandpour soap into my embed molds i did not do a good job  i literally just i scarfed it    im not gonna lie but heres to hoping they turn out okay anyway or at least that i can fix them later so were gonna let these guys sit here for a while and then well find out in a second if they worked i dont know i i might have to do this again  in addition to prepping the meltandpour ahead of time the ingredients for the soap frosting need to be prepped ahead of time as well  and basically the reason were making our oil mixture and our lye water for our frosting now is so we can leave them in the fridge overnight because they need to be cold we combine them in order for them to like make frosting peaks  measure and melt out the frosting oils  starting with the  ounces of cocoa butter which sort of conveniently come in like chocolate chip form they call them pastilles  oh thats so fun its like dippin dots or couscous  its got a couscous vibe to it  its got couscous vibes followed by  ounces of shea butter  it looks like goat cheese  it does  or like a hunk of mozzarella  oh yeah hunky  oooh thats cheesy its kind of crazy  its dangerously cheesy  its dangerously cheesy and then finally  ounces of olive oil and  ounces of coconut oil so now that we have all of our oils measured out im going to melt all of these together in the microwave  say farewell to my little friend then give it a quick little mix oh yahh now thats what im talking about that is smoooooth and then stick it in the fridge for cold use tomorrow and then were gonna move on to the lye water for this step which means its time to bring out the toxins  bring em out bring em out  first suit up for safety gloves longsleeves long pants kids pets gone in the other room and of course the always protective goggles  all right so i am going to start off by putting  ounces of distilled water into our eight cup mixing bowl and were using such a huge bowl for such a small amount of water because i actually have a cap for this one so we can put it in our fridge with a cap on but no one cares so lets just do it  well its just to let everyone know that were trying to be safe here  im just im using a cap im using protection tyler why are you so defeated  i dont know no one cares about why im using a big bowl i dont know i just thought it would be better leave me alone all right thats good thats  on the dot baby im talking about distilled water baby and then next up we need  ounces of the big baddie so i am going to take my lye out of its biohazard bag  its hazmat suit  its just you know its the universal sign for danger but were doing it anyway and after we measure it out were gonna add our lye into our water now im gonna be stirring my lye in slowly with a stainless steel spoon this will cause a chemical reaction and its gonna get hot in thurr so just know that but its not gonna stay hot because were gonna put it in the fridge so im gonna cover it up and stick it next to our oil mixture and that is gonna wrap up day one of our soap cupcake making adventure so first up on day two is to make the proverbial stump of the cupcakes the cake part  yeah  if you will  all about that base  the butt for which were gonna need pigments fragrance oils and lye water which were gonna combine and pour into our special soap cupcake mold  start by dispersing our colorants  now annemarie uses white green and blue colorants together to make like a teal cupcake but i was thinking since were going for sort of a nocturnal vibe with our cupcake why not go for something a little darker  ooh  so i picked up this where is it its literally  oop  right in front of me there we go this orchid mica which is like a deep purple pigment so i was thinking well just use this annemarie add one tablespoon of a lightweight oil into three different mixing containers saf now for the sake of the recipe i figured we should just use the same amount of oil one two  two and three quarters  three mwahaha and the same amount of pigment that annemarie does but its just all gonna be orchid mica and then its time to minimix them together  oh sht that looks like a fidget spinner  it does  alright i think were good to go  great alright so now that my pigments are mixed in i can retire my mini mixer for the time being and move on to our fragrances i believe  im going to measure out my champagne and my white rose fragrance oil from brambleberrycom so that everything is ready to go  i should put them somewhere right they should go somewhere  ideally yes  lets put them in here  this blend is  ounces of champagne fragrance oil and one ounce of white rose fragrance oil  alright im gonna start off with the champagne ohhhhhh mmm that smells amazing actually im not even that big of a fan of champagne but it smells like our car air freshener we used to have  oh damn really  it smells like sprite that is the best thing ive smelled all day  youve been smelling me all day  ive just been smelling tyler all day and he smells like uh  yeah what do i smell like  you smell like a roasted ham    oh the white rose is way anticlimactic now yeah its just got kind of like a a soapy grandmas house smell  together its a wonderful fragrance  alright so those are my fragrance oils prepped and now we have to move on to making the oil mixture for our bases alright so for my oils im gonna start off with  ounces of sweet almond oil oh  on the dot on the dizzot people dont do that anymore do they  no one ever did that   okay alright im gonna pretend that didnt happen followed by four ounces of coconut oil four ounces of olive oil  ounces of palm oil and then finally  ounces of shea butter oh yeah that is a crinklecut goat cheese slice thats what im talking about man and with all of those melted oh my god its hot its hot and then mixed together our oil soup is ready and its time now to make the lye water for our base its poison part 2 bret michaels strikes back so im gonna suit up for safety again hair is up goggles are on and gloves are on cats are gone singular cat cat is gone just me tyler and some toxins lets do this now unlike for our soap frosting where the oils and the lye water need to be cold when we combine them for our cupcake base were gonna mix them when theyre at about  degrees fahrenheit each so were gonna have to wait for our lye water to cool down all right now its at  degrees fahrenheit  so we got a second here  and also microwave our oil mixture to be warmer yeah lets do that and after a few minutes theyre both at around the right temperature so theyre pretty much ready to be saponified   mix the lye water and the oil  alright so now im gonna pour the lye water down the shaft of my stick blender all right  now pulse your stick blender while stirring  oh shizz i forgot how aggressive this thing was  until you get to a nice light trace  now whilst blending  annemarie mentions this thing called trace which is basically a term that refers to the thickness of your soap batter like once you completely combine your oils and lye water you can stop blending pretty quickly to get a light trace or a soap batter thats still liquidy and pourable or continue to blend to get a more viscous medium or thick trace and one thing i learned the hard way last time is if you overblend your soap  uhoh you cant really controlz it and make it a lighter trace again  oh no so were gonna be really careful this time and try and get a super light trace to start with do you think its trace yet tyler not yet
saf  i would say i would give it like a couple more bursts because weve been burned before it definitely looks like its all combined it might not be trace yet  but lets just put in our pigments now and then if its not trace enough well just mix it more later  yes  right  light trace is a perfect time to add fragrance and colorants  alright so now we go pigments  okay  and once our color is fully mixed in oo thats pretty thats super pretty we have to put in half of our fragrance blend as well annemarie just eyeballs it so as she says we do maybe thats about half  one more little spritz  continue to blend until medium trace or a thin pudding   oh shizz okay were good i think maybe we need to eat more pudding to become better soapers cause like one is a light pudding versus a medium pudding versus like a flan like i dont know  once youre out of thin pudding trace pour this into the mold and tap for bubbles  alright i would say that this is good to pour what do you think  i think so  great lets do it alright so i have my cupcake mold i say lets boogie  boogie central  i have to remember this isnt like actual baking where youre not supposed to fill it to the top shizz  everything okay  yeah of course i just dont know how to get the last bit out  give it a little spank   smack that as akon says nay demands smack that alright so now that our mixture is in im going to jiggle it a little bit to get rid of air bubbles and to like settle the soap into the mold alright did we shakd it i feel like we shakd it  you shookd it  and then its time to move on to our cupcake frosting which surprisingly and intimidatingly is the hard part  move your soap out of the way and its time to work on step 2 soap frosting okay so for our frosting were basically gonna be hand mixing our now solid oils sort of like butter in a buttercream frosting and then adding in our cold lye water and fragrance as we continue to beat so that we come out at the end with a smooth pipeable frosting all right ready  yeah 
  oh yeah  there we go
  aww yeah  woooahhhh wooooahhhhhhh woahhhhh  this is a pretty good i see some hard chunks and im just gonna break them up  making some inroads in there  i actually am  youre gonna be doing this for like 5 to 7 minutes  oh perfect  i want everything to be nice and smooth here   i feel like im trying to like ride a wild stallion woahhhh wahhhh im ok im ok  oh you know what youre kind of doing like the bucking bronco at a bar  yeah this is my mechanical bull    this is it all right lets lets take a look at this i think that we might be pretty softened we basically just need it to be soft enough so we can like fold in the lye water and then start whipping again  yeah  i think im feeling that from it so lets bring out the lye now anne marie basically says if youre feeling daredevilish enough you can pour the lye water in while youre hand mixing like with the electric mixer but i am nervous that im not good at this so im gonna fold the lye water in with a silicone spatula as she says it is fair to do it sounds squelchy doesnt it just minimize any lye splashing  you never ever ever want to splash lye anywhere  its not an iconic duo lye and splashing  no  so its better to be safe than sorry and just mix in very very slowly  the lye water is kind of like sort of pooling at the bottom a little but i think im getting it i will have a very buff hand by the end of this one one buff hand are you into that tyler  im gonna have to be   once your lye water is fully incorporated turn on the blender and mix for another probably five to seven minutes  alright so all of our lye is at least in the bowl and attempted to be folded in so lets turn on our hand mixer again and just blend the crap out of this thing  alright lets get those muscles babe  alright lets do it i got it i got it here we go here we go its happening its happening  youre really looking for your icing to be able to form and sustain peaks  annes key word here is definitely peaks she wants peaks the whole peak and nothing but the peak  peaks peaks peaks peaking abilities  ooh its getting fluffy  fluffy  its getting fluffy  oh its looking good actually  i mean i feel like this is pretty frostingy i think that it is sustaining peaks so i think we could be ready to put in our fragrance oil shall we  yeah  pour the rest of the fragrance oil blend into the icing notice this kind of decreases the peaking ability youre gonna have to blend some more probably another five to seven minutes saf im trying to make sure i get it all get every inch of this thing just show it no mercy annemarie you want your mixture to be soft enough so that you can actually put it into the frosting bag but yet it needs to also be strong enough to hold whatever frosting peaks you create saf oh yeah ty that looks like a peak what do you think about that tyler im peaking so hard right now what saf what annemarie this is a really kind of fine line to find saf all right i think that it can sustain peaks tyler i think so too i think it can because i feel like  take a look at this yeah ignore the incredibly messy bowl tyler it looks like frosting saf it looks peaky tyler i think we should go for it saf all right lets do it so now i am going to spoon my mixture into my frosting bag and then drag my cupcake bases into the frame and were gonna try to do this thing man annemarie just gonna scoop a couple scoops into my frosting bag saf my hand is literally shaking tyler cause youre nervous saf no because ive been handmixing for so long tyler oh damn saf annemarie must be secretly buff tyler dude saf notsosecretly annemaries definitely buff tyler yeah annemarie there we go hold firmly with one hand and then guide it to the middle of the first cupcake and just put a dollop of frosting in the middle of that cupcake saf well its the moment of truth everyone time to frost tyler moms spaghetti safi saf im going for this one okay that looks okay tyler that looks incredible saf that looks okay right annemarie now move on to the next one were going for a dollop in the middle of each of our cupcakes saf alright here we go were dolloping tyler tyler maybe give them like a little bit more she kind of gives it like two jounces saf like a bigger dollop like this tyler yeah saf okay yeah that looks better to me annemarie perfect were gonna build around these saf all right all right all right are they holding their form tyler dude definitely saf cool so what i need to do now is annemarie do one circle around the base of that dollop saf once again im going for the same one okay oh sht oh sht oh sht oh sht oh sht oh sht oh sht oh sht tyler are these good shts saf okay okay tyler good shts or bad shts saf tyler i dont know annemarie move on and do all of the cupcakes saf ohh fck fck fck fck fck fck fck annemarie this provides an excellent base to build gorgeous soap frosting peaks saf okay boys stay frosty here annemarie and now its time to do our peaks saf alright so im gonna go tyler for all the marbles saf northwards if that makes sense tyler lets go north saf im going to go towards the sky fck okay im so nervous annemarie start going around your dollop of frosting there we go now were building it perfect saf boop tyler ohhhhhhhh dude saf it looks like an amateur yogurtland experiment tyler okay saf but its not a fail tyler no its not its sustaining peaks look at that peak right there right look at that thats like a cupcake thats discovering itself saf all right lets try this one too oh fck fck fck fck tyler a little bit of a rogue squirt saf i did start off with a rogue squirt tyler that looks pretty solid safiya saf alright  annemarie im almost not exhaling im so worried that these are gonna fall but theyre doing great saf the good thing is our windows are open so its kind of cold in here which is supposed to help the peaks stay tyler yeah annemarie nice good height tyler its kind of like uh a nipple saf yeah tyler yeah its its exactly like a nipple actually saf its literally a nipple annemarie there i love the height were getting on this this is just fantastic tyler you know why dont you get a little aggressive with this guy go a little higher saf should i make this one taller is that what youre trying to say
tyler  yes tyler make this guy mr frosty or whatever saf like that tyler yeah saf okay
 that ones really tall now tyler yeah its the fcking lizard king  saf youre gonna regret the day you ever messed with me im the fckin lizard king you dont even know my real name robert california i will not be blackmailed by some ineffectual privileged effete softpenisd debutante you dont even know my real name saf that is what annemarie is gonna say when she calls our house later robert california im the fcking lizard king saf alright so it would be stupid for me to try and add more frosting to any of these right this one looks like it could use a little bit more but at the same time i feel like if i fck it up worse now ill be mad at myself tyler okay saf so i should just not tyler put it down saf alright im gonna put the frosting bag down tyler put the bag down lady annemarie now just the last final few touches time for glitter cause everything is better with glitter saf now annemarie uses sort of like aa plain white glitter but on brambleberrycom i found some silver holo glitter tyler damn thats the goodgood saf and i figured we had to get it tyler hell yeah now its over your sleeve saf oh now im just covered in holo glitter didnt think about that annemarie and then finally gonna top with those really cute pink embeds from earlier saf alright so now we have our embeds we popped these guys out a couple of hours ago its going down im yelling timber just in case we needed to redo this entire step but thankfully a lot of them came out pretty well like most of the stars 
tyler  saf oh my god its cute some of the moons oh wait itits actually i would even say this is hella cute and even a couple of the bats tyler ohhh
saf  oh my god hes so cute and fun came out looking pretty good or at least medium oh the back is messed up but the front is okay and the ones that i completely scarfed with my bad pouring job were at least salvageable with an exacto knife now thats what i call surgery tyler theyre going under the knife saf what is this the real housewives of beverly hills tyler yes saf im not gonna apologize for that im just gonna let it let it sit so weve got a fair amount to work with in terms of what can go on our cupcakes so what im gonna do is sort of treat my frosting like clouds in the sky with my stars and moons peeking out from behind the clouds and the bat sort of flying in front tyler  that one is pulling it off saf yeah i do like that obviously i have no idea what im doing here but im just trying to let the muses guide my hand also based on the nature of the soap cupcake once you place an embed you cant really move it so i just gotta be okay with wherever they end up tyler its kind of like pringles but you know the fun does stop right saf once you pop it the fun does stop yes absolutely alright so those are all of our embeds placed into our cupcakes im honestly pretty pleased with them this is my first batch of soap cupcakes and i feel like expectations were pretty low okay so im gonna stick my cupcakes in the fridge for a couple of hours woohoohoo welcome to bootytown what that means i do not know just so the frosting really sets i hope everything goes okay in there  all right i guess we should clean up now tyler probably saf alright so its the next day the cupcakes have been sitting in the fridge for a couple of hours and then out of the fridge for many more hours and it feels like its time to pop them out of the mold so they can cure in the air tyler pop those bottles saf yes its time to pop these bottles its time to clap these cakes what time to never mind tyler is that a butt thing saf as i said it its yes i think so yeah alright im going for this one tyler alright lets do it annemarie so the way it works if you pull gently away from the side youre really working to release this air lock saf so basically i have to like push it up and then grab it from the base oh my god i think i just put my nail in it oh oh oh oh oh its out did i put my nail in it too bad a little bit i can just smooth it though right its soap its fine tyler its soap saf alright that looks pretty nice the frosting is very asymmetric its umm interpretive modern flowing its like a gaudí house but besides that it looks like a cupcake to me tyler i mean saf it looks pretty good saf so lets get the rest of these out here and see how we did across the board oh oh not bad not bad not bad thats cupcake number three oot and aboot tyler oot and aboot saf now there are a couple of these that are a little less lumpy a little more straight up and down but in general i would say that they are cute sufficiently batty still intact but not very uniform in fact if i had to describe my cupcakes it would be homemade with love but not much skill tyler i think you should just go the route of modern art and just go everythings intentional saf right exactly tyler its fcked up meant it saf i put my nail on the side meant that too that rogue squirt right there all part of the plan so with that in mind i hereby present to you our finished cupcakes now in order to actually use these guys as soap bars we have to wait about four to six weeks for them to cure or for all of the water to evaporate out of them im so nervous how do i even do this tyler i dont know saf oh it feels soapy but they did last all of those weeks sitting in our kitchen despite almost being destroyed by a rogue sriracha bottle and although we were able to get a nice lather going  oh there we go oooh yeah okay look at that  i will say they are kind of a strange shape to wash your hands with because im not exactly sure like how i should grasp them and i also feel a little sad using them because i want them to stay  perfect little cupcakes you know so i feel like these will probably end up being more like decorative bath treats rather than functional ones but nonetheless i feel very accomplished having made these on my own or at least in annemaries shadow because it was overall pretty hard especially for a soap peasant like me thankfully now the only challenge left is to not eat them so im off to get a real cupcake before things get ugly thank you guys so much for watching if you liked that video make sure to shmash that like button and if you want to see more videos like this make sure to shmash that subscribe button a big shout out to caitie for watching thanks for watching caitie and i will see you guys anext time were gonna have to go to thesaurus calm and think of a new word for smash were gonna say it like six thousand times is this video the video where we change our outro hello friends and welcome to another video this week im gonna be destroying every bath bomb from lush and then reforming them into one single franken bath bomb thats right tonight we are going where no bad science video has ever gone before the bathroom so previously on our channel ive mixed together a lot of things including a hell of a lot of lipstick an impressive amount of booty guru eyeshadow and also some non makeup items like every candle from bath  body works and every possible wedding cake flavor bad makeup science has really just gone off the rails at this point so i figured while were offroading it might as well take a bath now some of you may know of a chain of skincare stores called lush which is famous for its handmade products its colorful and wacky bath goods and also the signature robust smell of its stores thats strong thats a wall of fragrance its kind of like subway but instead of smelling like italian herbs and cheese you come out smelling like a robust vanilla tea bag and some of russias most popular products are their fizzing bath bombs which for the uninitiated are basically like solid balls of soap oils and fragrances which you drop into a bath to get some skincare or aromatherapy benefits and also for funsies now as an avid smeller and looker adder of fancy bath products lush is for me often a top destination when going to a mall and it was during one of these visits while flagellating my nostrils with floral aromas that the oh so familiar urge to destroy combined and birth anew struck me the time had to make a franken lush bath bomb and to become the ruler of sense the archduke of odors the emperor of aromas the life of bath canterbury tales anyone know just me okay also you guys have been requesting this one for a while so lets do it all right so we are here at the lush store at the century city mall ready to buy some bath bombs to smash to shamash if you will oh thats gonna get old fast so we quickly got to work there right here bath bombs right here filling up their little egg crates with one bomb of each variety im trying to like figure out in my way of determining which is the best one you know like youre supposed like knock on a watermelon or something give them a good squeeze i feel like that will destroy them do not honka honka the bath bombs now although the classic bath bomb is round lush does do a fair amount of variation in terms of texture what is this the belly button oh thats a navel yeah oh it does look like a navel sighs oh wow theyre giant ones giant giant giant and shapes ooh like eggplants phallic and treasure chests why is the rum always gone just to keep things fresh and smooth thats the guardian of the forest the nigh guardian of the forest wow i dont know what to say for myself i have nothing to say blush does also make a lot of bath balm adjacent items all right so weve got body conditioner body butter magic christic crystals i do not know what that is im gonna leave that over here like shower bombs and bubble bars what about a bubble rune a bubble what a bubble rune was that tyler do i look like i know but just to maintain the sanctity of our formula were gonna go with just the traditional bath bombs yes im ready to ready to check out and after ransacking the store we ended up with  bath bombs now luscious bath bomb lineup does change rather frequently as there are many limited edition location exclusive bombs so im gonna say we probably missed at least a couple but we definitely got a healthy chunk oh i thought of bath bombs and with our haul in hand it was time to commence our experiment lets go home and smash him lets go home and smash him yall lets kick the camera ting its like a kick in the face okay so we have all of our bath bombs here and today our goal is to smash all of our bath bombs puree them in our food processor and then form them into bath bombs with our bath bomb press i like it im holding a weapon in my hand and very threatening here beckoning with the hammer bob the builder is quaking also in case youre wondering where i am we moved say hello to the new kitchen hello so weve divided our  bath bombs into nine different color categories so im gonna be smashing and pure aying by color so we can keep our color separate and then use our color categories to try and make a layered rainbow design in our bath bomb i cant make any promises but were gonna try and make it cute and were gonna start smashing with the pink category so our first bath bomb is called twilight twilight new bath twilight breaking bath bombs mood and it just smells pretty sweet i would say it smells like what bellas blood smelled like to edward raging hormones all right shall we yeah should i hold it probably just dont hit your fingers oh you know what i should use this side so im kind of like axe picking that did nothing that did absolutely nothing okay oh oh here it goes if i dig deeper do you think ill find renesmee nose that lets bellas baby whoa thats what im talking about oh its really blue inside so im gonna just break these into like a few smaller pieces yeah there we go alright im figuring it out man so besides twilight there are eight other pink bath bombs five of which are traditional spheres im gonna grab i think this rosy one next including a sex bomb which is apparently one of their most popular i mean lush is nothing if not horny yeah we also have magma all right im gonna try and like pick at the seam do you think thatll work sure whoa oh my god it actually yes marshmallow world this ones breaking good as opposed to breaking bad i wasnt going over there choco mint and pink just pink oh yeah that would did like a backflip blanket safety disclaimer im sure im not using a hammer correctly so just dont do anything i do ever besides those we have three oddly shaped bombs strawberries and cream oh yeah a lucky cat oh yeah there is like a gold bar inside what is that i dont know but im covered in cat and a peach emoji they call me the booty destroyer you dont like that no yeah absolutely no reaction from tyler okay yeah so those were the pinks up next are the oranges into the yellows now there are only like two and a half orange bath bombs since one of them is like orange and yellow and first up is yuzu and coco i keep thinking its called like my navel but i think that thats just because thats what i think every time i look at it were any of them called my navel no but a fuzzy navel is a kind of orange drink so i thought it would like work well but its fine its fine im fine with it its fine and then the only other full orange bath bomb is this one called yuki hi this is totally not the vibe of this bath bomb but when i look like straight into the camera with it its a i of sauron no you dont think so now its more like his bellybutton mmm the navel of sauron mmhmm and then to finish out the oranges we have our fruity giant bombshell its also like tied together so i think there might be stuff inside whoa what the hell are we gonna do with a whole bunch of dehydrated orange slices i dont want to mess with our bath bombs formula too much so im just gonna leave these out and maybe we can make potpourri with them later or something so im gonna hammer the orange first and im gonna keep them separated so ill like put the orange half with the orange category and the yellow half with the yellow category this is flying soren break and free natasha bedingfield song no its a high school musical reference tyler is showing his age here im woefully ignorant of high school musical theres not a star in heaven that it cant reach whos that its its still high school musical besides the giant dude if there are three other yellow bath bombs honey i washed the kids it does have slight death star vibes but like happy death star royalty i feel like cady heron mrs regicide when she like divides up the crown amongst all of the spring fling attendees and turmeric latte whoo oh its mustardy in there like a spicy dijon mustard all right so that is the end of the yellows on to the greens starting with the plainness of the mall this one which is called bow bath besides that one avocado thanks we also have four other green bath bombs including the guardian of the forest its grouped everyone in bath bomb form and also this one mel youve seen mellymel using mel usin a mucinous its mucinex yeah mel you see it mel you dont we also have two fun shaped ones like a little turtle were gonna find out if youre totally enough for the turtle club now well theyve rejected me so im acting out and a treasure chest called the pirates of the caribbean for carrageenan like ive been placebo and it smells like the chlorine in like the pirates of the caribbean ride at disneyland its a little musty smelling damp room it smells damp oh ah doesnt aggressive strike that was cinematic okay chest destroyed treasure acquired greens done lets move on to blue now there are a lot of blue bath bombs nine to be exact and interestingly a lot of them have like extra ingredients incorporated into them you can see some of the seaweed in there well kelpy so for the dry ingredients that are like mixed into the bath bomb formula were just gonna leave those in there and hope the food processor takes care of the rest but anything we can remove like sea salt rocks or cocoa butter polyps oh oh oh theres butter in here were gonna do our best to get rid of so that is a full and extraction right there its kind of like dr pimple popper if dr pimple popper murdered people then yes it is like that too besides those ones with like surprises inside there are also a lot of uniquely shaped bath bombs in this category like this little bottle of comb its a small bean rocket science miss molly i dont know it smells like elon musk thats not bad ill let that one fly rose butterflies theres some reason i was looking at that bath bomb i just had nelly furtados im like a bird in my head me too wait actually me i was thinking that in might i dont know why we are on the same wavelength is that the butterfly effect no and this pale blue robot you know whats up you are lord farquaad right now i was about to say ginger man from shrek vibes tyler we are vibing right now maybe what happens is that were tripping from all of the lush powder its lush but its really just ayahuasca and after that its time for the purple category starting with goddess oh house smell it smells like the gift shop at colonial williamsburg does it really konya williamsburg really had a i love it there besides that one we also have a lumpy blackberry bath bomb and a lavender bomb shrouded in gaads i think theyre like in the bath your supposed to keep it in there because i think there is lavender in here so then itll stay in like its a little satchel as it dissolves but i think that for our purposes i should take it out of the bag that one smells amazing its just straight lavender to the face but its really good and then the last purple bath bomb is the eggplant emoji i feel like the meme that will be associated with this will be when tyler pisses off sofia oh my god i would never sounds like a  florida lawsuit florida woman hammers junk surprise alien dick like i said before lush is nothing if not horny oh i almost just said farewell sweet penis but thats not good cant really say that can i you did just say it alright lets just leave it at that okay yeah so that concludes the purple category now were on to the black bath bombs of which there are only two im gonna start off with the illuminati eye this one actually used to be named dark arts but you know apparently jk rowling took a break from twitter to unleash her inner lawsuit and now its called secret arts secret arts this other one is called black rose and it essentially looks like if our merch was a bath bomb i would say basically yeah thats fair its pretty on brand i like it alright so those are our two black bath bombs up next is the white  beige category now there are eight neutral bath bombs and in the interest of time were just gonna smash and then pass through them is there a song called smack that from the  i was gonna say smack that out on the floor oh yeah all right let me do the but first presumably thats what what a conman you know smack in the butts you know but though we are trying to hack our way through this category as fast as possible as it gets later i become more ruthless please pray for my thumbs there are a few interesting dudes in here like dragons egg whoa its yogi our ep gudetama another funfilled giant bombshell oh its like a whole ass dried rose and a second mummified bath bomb look at that debris in there thats a chunky monkey it looks like garlic butter you know when you see butter that has like extra goodies in it like hands mary and i dont like that imagery but it smells pretty good and with those smack  all on the floor its time to move on to our last category the multicolored bath bombs are you ready to bathe the rainbow thats all i got of which there are three this dual toned one moon spell oh whoa theres a moon in there im not sure like what utility you get out of that in the bath but its pretty cool the psychedelic groovy kind of love dye lava lamp dye and our final bath bomb of them all the love boat where should i go the the bow or the stern also which ones which poop deck wheres the poop deck oh goodbye poop deck were about to sink this love boat this boats heart will not go on thats actually not bad i didnt see that coming so with that we have crapped smacked and smashed all  of our bath bombs and it is time now to move on to the food processing portion of the experiment i do have two food processors here one mama and one baby just in case theres too much chunk too many chunk too many chunks one thing to note before we get started is that after smashing some of the bath bombs revealed other colors inside so weary categorized a couple of them including the entire rainbow section so we now only have eight groups to grind all right lets see if i know how to use a food processor with you starting with pink ready yeah go for it lets pound some rock which i hold the top thats a good food processor i think its literally done its pulverized im not shocked i thought i was gonna have to like go at it for a second this is awesome what else could we put in there haha now as we are puree our bath bomb powder to go into our rainbow design  dude i am totally gonna break this thing theres like no question there is one dynamic of this experiment we havent talked about too much ooh which is the odor this one smells like mint toothpaste it looks like cotton candy but it smells refreshing so as we blend our categories to a pulp oh my god oh yeah i feel like this ones wilder were gonna give each one a good sniff woo that one smells amazing yeah its like orange jasmine this ones my favorite to see just what kind of sense were working with here im gonna to switch this thing yeah stranger things style and what we found was that the smells were all over the place theres like smoke rising out of this way now its like if lush got dusted by thanos with some kind of fresh scent dude citrus citrus im getting nothing else literally just lemon some more comforting smells this one kind of smells like a christmas cookie i think the turmeric is turning it spicy and some herbaceous aromas hmm it kind of smells like a citrusy chamomile tea herbal tea the blue category went a little stereotypical this one smells like a oceanic glade plugin like fake ocean smell i would say and the block bath bombs though small in number now thats what you call the black long packed a serious potpourri punch it looks like soot but it smells like dried flowers not fresh flowers dead flowers and honestly i dont even know what happened in the purple category that does not smell good that smells a really bad actor smell like it smells like a baby wipe like a diaper bag yeah i dont want to be than that i guess thats all to say that theres a lot going on here so im interested to see which fragrances will come out on top im just hoping its not the purple the rest of them smell nice this one is just funky but with that we do have all of our color categories dusted so its finally time to make our bath bomb we have destroyed and now we must rebuild now when most people set out to make a bath bomb theyre making them from scratch like with a recipe but in our case we are trying to revive dead bath bombs which makes our process a little different specifically were going to need to wet our powder so it will restate to itself and keep the shape of a bath bomb but also make sure that it will still fizz when we drop it in the tub so to make our formula we are going to be adding baking soda oil and citric acid to all of our individual color categories nope and the citric acid and the baking soda are gonna be what causes the bomb to react with water and the oil will hopefully be our binding agent we could also use witch hazel but because its more watery and because were beginners were afraid we might prematurely activate the franken bath bomb powder while mixing now this is a little time sensitive because they can dry out and we need them all to be wet at the same time so tyler is gonna be helping me were gonna be doing a couple of the colors offcamera and hopefully we can figure this out technically our powder should be fizzy without this stuff like there is already citric acid and baking soda in there but since were adding more oil into our mixture we wanted to make sure the ratios were right and once we have all eight colors prepped it looks pretty good yeah i think its ready to go go for it we can bust out the real star of the show so this is our bath bomb making machine it is an industrial bath bomb press that we bought on a whim and now were using it which im very excited about there are other bath bomb making methods notably molds but we thought this machine seen more exciting and the way it works is that it has a little cup or mold that you fill up with your bath bomb batter were gonna be putting alternating spoonfuls of each of our colors in like in rainbow order to try and make a striped pattern i think that seems pretty good actually its nice and perfect once its full you place your cup underneath the pressing arm of the device and then the machine is gonna use air pressure to like pretty aggressively compact your formula into a bath bomb oh this is the coolest thing ever then you twist and flip the mold and push the bath bomb into your hand oh no no which for our zombie bath bombs was easier said than done its beautiful but sad here is bath bomb attempt number one it is cool as hell but it did not work were trying it again were not giving up we had a pretty hard time trying to figure out how to make this machine work for us oh sadness which kind of makes sense because its an industrial press and i would hardly say we are in the bath bomb industry oh yeah we how did that happen in fact if anything i would say we are actively undermining the bath bomb industry wow but regardless we just could not get our bath bombs to stop splitting in half down the middle mmhmm its stuck in there and its full unstuck up there whether they made it out of the press or not no so after trying a few different troubleshooting methods like greasing up freakin everything the press and the batter shaking our formula as we spooned it in shake it good shake it and desperately holding the mold together as the pressing arm lifted high everyone hold on to their butts again we still failed oh it might have just fallen into my hand as you can see this side is a bit soft and like kind of crumbled but the other side oh literally as i said but the other side is good it imploded in my hands so we finally decided to as a kind of hail mary change up the order of the colors going into the mold dont try inverse rainbow lets try inverse rainbow just because roy gb that didnt really seem to be working for us it looks like broccoli lets do this is the broccoli avenger okay all right here we go shake it like a polaroid picture okay okay okay i see it i see it already central no one say anything dont breathe okay wait its still in my hand how do i how do i get out of your hand and hold on okay okay oh my god thats a frankie bath bomb ah someone pinched me so i guess the inverse rainbow thing was the best idea we had all night i thought you were gonna dwight schroot it and that it was gonna make the watermelon the bath ball may look a little green but dont worry there are a lot of the other colors in there theyre just hiding inside that is a sexyass bath bomb can i make out with a bath bomb so with one multilayered franken bath bomb produced this is rock and roll man those are appropriate rock horns this is rock and roll we took a few more whacks at it to make a backup bath bomb just in case dont ask why its so wet i did some things im not proud of and then just as kind of like a secondary test we decided to use the remains of our earlier failed attempts to make another franken bath bomb its gonna be the phoenix bath bomb from the fallen attempts it shall rise i call it the franken swamp bomb its beautiful its perfect that was like the eighth baby for octomom it just kind of walked out just ran out of the womb and after quickly making a back up swampy we were pretty much ready to retire the machine all right so we have two bath bombs of each variety and so basically all we have to do is wait a couple of days for them to dry out and then we can all take a bath together its very its a very roman video you know yeah thats the vibe hello friends and welcome to my tub we are here a few days after forming our frank and bath bombs two bigs the backbones do seem like decently dried out im nervous to touch them im nervous to look at them so its time to bomb this bath all right bring in the bath bomb oh i got it all right im gonna sniff it a good sign is that it doesnt overwhelmingly smell like lavender but its hard to identify like exactly what im smelling its definitely like a sweet smell would it be a copout to say it just smells like the lush store who would that be a copout after doing some serious investigative sniffing i think the dry franken bath balm smells most like a combo of rocket science and rose butterfly which have sicilian lemon bergamot and rose oil in bama so it basically smells like elon musk with a hint of nelly furtado but lets see how that holds up in the bath shall i cannonball or like gently lower oh cannonball okay ready good bye oh its fizzing oh it is a purple and green bomb oh its split in half oh theres one half wheres the other half right here oh what a great emergence so as for first impressions it is very fizzy which is great and whats also fun about it is that as the bath bomb dissolves you can see the different color categories come to the surface oh no here i got some yellow its like a sorting hat bath bomb yes yellow orange im seeing some blue as well so we did get some bath utility out of our rainbow design oh oh yeah look at that emergence hi sis ah were gonna bottle this and sell it for  in the internet right right yeah right bad makeup science bathwater do i have to like pour it down my butt crack for it to be worth something on that market yes now with our bath bomb fully disintegrated we were able to get a better look at just what it had done to the tub so this is a shredder bath bomb hes got layers to right its got layers it ends up green and swampy ah it doesnt smell like onions thankfully but it does look the part now as for what it actually smells like oh interesting yeah as im smelling my franken bathwater  on top of i it smells way different than like the actual bath bomb did before we dropped it in oh yeah it smells much more florally whereas the dry bath bomb was dominated by more of a sweet citrus scent but both floral and orange sense make sense when you look at the most common ingredients across all of our bath bombs as lavender rose alang alang jasmine and chamomile are all in the top  along with lemon orange and bergamot theres also a lot of cocoa butter even when you consider the lumps we removed though that doesnt really have a strong scent but when you team it up with all of the almond oil we use to rebuild the bombs it definitely makes it very moisturizing and slick in here let me oh oh oh im sorry oh farewell farewell cruel world besides moisturizing the top ingredients also have soothing relaxing cleansing and energizing properties so its basically like a soapy four loko its an upper and a downer you know im facing towards  for her freaking bath bought bath water so you better pay up if youre gonna drink up tyler also wanted to lend his nostrils to the cause right this is making me uncomfortable and were married and though he tried his best it does smell like wash he brought few insights if any but not to close the door on any future odor investigations we did actually save one mason jars worth of franken girl bath water ooh yum not to sell just to have now we did also want to do a really quick bath test with the franken swamp balm and though it obviously doesnt look the same oh yeah it looks like when sponge bob had the suds it did bring our bathwater to that familiar shrek ehue i feel like mine is more clumpy and i feel like theres more like a general multicolored nough stew it but it is certainly converging to swamp water green and emit a mild lemony flower aroma there you go tyler williams chest hair bathwater these thighs dont lie how its hips dont lie and with tyler and his chest hair thoroughly enjoying their bath i can just rotate like this almost like like one of those pigs sits on a thing like a pig on a spit relax it seemed that our first episode of bath makeup science had come to an end i feel overall that was a pretty successful bath bomb experience i really enjoyed the sheer amount of smashing and smelling i got to do in this experiment i feel youre gonna snot rocket later sawfish to be multicolored that would be fun and it was also a very gratifying francon experience because we were able to figure out how to make all of this into a bath bomb which ended up being not bad and i was really happy with both the design and the fizziness of our final product that said i wouldnt say it was the worlds greatest or most luxurious bath bomb like im not feeling like the effects and niceness of all of the bath bombs from lush together it is less than the sum of its parts if that makes sense but its not the worst its not too chunky and it doesnt smell like butt so i feel like thats good so in conclusion i had fun i would make bath bombs again though probably not from the ashes of  other bath bombs and i am not sure what were gonna do with our mason jars full of bath water but my moneys on family heirloom probably well we had our freaking candle at our wedding maybe on our ear well have our franken bathwater gross but romantic thank you guys so much for watching if you liked that video make sure to smash that like button and if you want to see more videos like this make sure to shamash that subscribe button a big shout out to amanda for watching thanks for watching amanda and i will see you guys a next bath  this is safiyas new intro song hello friends and welcome to another video today im gonna be trying out amazons personal shopping service because we all know that jeff bezos is a stylin dude billions of dollars one killer vest so a few weeks ago i was trawling the internet bottomfeeding like a carpet shark as i am want to do and i stumbled upon a few articles announcing the launch of amazons new personal shopping service where basically amazon prime members can pay a small fee each month to take a fashion quiz and be matched up with a real live stylist as opposed to a robot stylist i felt like that needed to be said who will pick out things for you to wear now when i think of personal shoppers i sort of think of oldschool higherend department stores kind of like what rachel from friendss job was at bloomingdales my mom calls it bloomies so i think its kind of interesting that amazon has killed retail and now is trying to bring back things from it but it also feels like with this theyre trying to close in on the stitch fix style box space because the format is kind of similar where you take a quiz they give you suggestions you try things on and choose what to keep so it seems like amazon is just trying to eat everyones lunch who would steal  bag lunches but i guess well see how they do both in terms of figuring out my style and in terms of what the products themselves are like because amazon has sort of a huge spectrum of quality and price like will we be on the wish side of amazon or on like the nordstrom side of amazon i guess well find out so right now im gonna take this quiz and then in a few days theyll give me a personal shopper and then well see what they come up with and if i dont end up bald and wearing a great vest im gonna be very upset alright lets do it so apparently the amazon personal shopping service is only available on the app for your phone so i have my phone i am screen recording that is why there is a computer here also i think i should just search for personal shopper right here we go i found the landing page introducing personal shopper by prime wardrobe let our stylists do the shopping for you just  a month cancel anytime well see about that amazon you cant really cancel anyone nowadays all right im gonna click lets get started bing ooh it says create your style profile customize your upcoming styling and sign up for your membership am i not already signed up for amazon prime is this like sign up inception i have to sign up for an account within my own account all right im gonna click next ah yes were on to the quiz now and the first question of my style profile is how often do you like to wear the following styles so it seems like its giving me sort of like outfit flat lays and then i have to say if i like them or not or how much i would wear them and the first one is casual i would say often i would say that i dont really wear real pants anymore so i think that counts towards often   i would say always edgy oh i mean i think this flat lay is definitely like more my vibe but i would say my daily style is more like edgy with yoga pants on im gonna say often on this one also next up romantic i do like like turtlenecks and lace but i feel like not necessarily in a romantic way so maybe i should say rarely alright sporty now im not sporty but i do like athleisure   yes i like leisure i edit most of my days   well we have that bike desk i dont use it but i like it   you like what it stands for yes oh and then the next one is glam which i would say i am rarely glam nothing against glam good for glam   good for glam you know wam bam hand in the glam its usually just wam bam hand in the clam   no its  wam bam thank you maam what   where did this clam reference come from i dont even know okay so the next one is minimal in a sort of monochromatic way i am minimal but i do like dramatic flourishes so i would say im sometimes minimal i would say thats pretty fair and then the last flat lay is retro now i do enjoy a good decade fashion adventure but im not sure my daily style is retro so im gonna say rarely and then click next lets see what else they have in the store for me ooh all right this is a question about brands oh no im never good at these which of the following are in your closet adidas yes alo yoga yes amazon essentials they have their own brand see i told you theyre coming for everyones merkin   they make everybodys merkin i mean it seems like amazon will soon be the worldwide manufacturer of merkins so everyone hang on to yours yeah i dont have that many brands i have like one pair of calvin klein underwear and four pairs of calin kelun underwear so um i dont see him on here im pretty disappointed about that oh ugg is on here i do have one very large pair of uggs so i feel like that counts   you shouldnt be including products from videos though see but if i dont then i only have like one brand checked so   ok got it ah so the next question is about colors and patterns that i dislike hm i feel like i should be honest and click everything   yeah ill leave like the neutrals on but im gonna get rid of colors just so they know that so currently whats left on there are neutrals grays blacks and silvers this is embarrassing for some reason i feel exposed so the next section is asking me how often i wear different clothing items first up is dresses im gonna say i often wear dresses actually when i shave my legs for like the week after that i wear only dresses jeans im not against them but i do rarely reach for them pants same deal if its not stretchy its not that i dont like it its that i dont wear it all right next ah now its asking me how i feel about specific trends midilength dresses and skirts im actually a big fan of like midi and maxi length things partially because it minimizes the amount of leg you have to shave and also because you can kind of sweep around you know you have kind of like a butt cape   a lot of your clothing decisions centralize around leg hair leg hair and also dramatic flourishes do i have to shave my legs and can i pretend im snape oohhoo the next trend is bell sleeves let me just smash that love it button circle hole what   smash that hole i didnt realize it sounded like that obviously i am a giant fan of bell sleeves bat wing sleeves giant sleeves really dramatic sleeves of any kind so they can send these to me all they want okay so the next question is about my body shape i think im straight up and down i think ive got wide shoulders and wide hips but not necessarily like a really small waist i think im just straight up and down   youre like celery what did we say in that video we did the perfect makeover video   youre like a rhubarb rhubarb ive got the rhubarb body type tylers into it   yeah the next couple of sections of the quiz are asking me how i like different clothing items to fit how much i like to highlight different parts of my body my height and my weight and my general sizes and theyre also giving me an opportunity to leave a little extra fit info for the stylist oh maybe i should tell them i have a big booty   okay i have decently long legs and kind of a big booty fyi alright next and then there are even more questions including some about my budget for which im just gonna check towards the middle of each category and then a series of questions about how often id like to receive certain vibes of items like businessy going to the cluby snugy those kinds of things and with that i am finally at the end of this quiz its gonna let me save my style profile so lets do that im gonna click continue alright so this is about my payment information   dont they know everything already they do they do they do ah ha my personal shopper subscription is confirmed and next up theyre gonna notify me when my stylists pics are ready so presumably in a few days that real life not robot stylist is gonna reach out to me and recommend me some stuff to wear so ill see you guys then alright so its a few days later and ive received a notification that my amazon shopper has picked out a few things for me to go through and see what i like from them tyler choose from thats better in general i havent been like contacted by any person besides this push notification like i havent chatted with anyone on the phone or like dm to anyone but i did participate in like a tinder style survey where amazon like gave me selections and then i would like swipe left or right if i liked them or not so that did provide them like a little more information than just the quiz that we took but besides that thats it okay so i guess we should just open up the app and see whats up shall we haha my pics already ive clicked in okay so they sent me a list of like  clothing items presumably based off of my style profile so they say that i should choose two to eight items from this list to try on at home for free theres two jackets on here two dresses for tops one pair of leggings and one pair of shoes they all seem to be name brands that i recognize so were definitely on the bloomies side of amazon versus the romwe side with the average price being about  per item overall these clothes look pretty decent if a little plain but im gonna hold off any real judgement until i can see them in person maybe i should try on eight just so we can see the most possible which means that two of these clothing items are getting out vitas aimed right now i think that i am going to leave out this gray turtleneck sweater just because its not really doing a lot for me and i cant really see myself keeping it so im not gonna waste its time and then the second item im gonna boot is this jean jacket i feel like although i do wear denim jackets a lot getting a plain denim jacket to try on is not the most exciting thing   no so i think im gonna eliminate that one as well and then well go with everything else basically so im going to say review and ship and we will see these items when they arrive here and we can try them on so next time you see me ill have my haul alright so its about a week later and we are here and ready to unbox i mean unbag our amazon personal shopper haul   oh wow its a pretty big sack   you just slammed that thing theres nothing fragile in there is there   no there isnt alright so this is my sack   this is your sack this is my sack   okay youre saying sack a lot i feel compelled to say sack it feels right in my mouth   oh my god  sorry why am i so raunchy today   i dont know ooh alright first up is i believe a white denim or linen jacket i kind of like this jacket actually when i see it in person its got a little bit of like a waist cincher and it also has like some nice like cargo sort of like military jacket vibes it feels nice its definitely the right weight for a los angeles jacket   so its like barely a jacket its barely a jacket yeah but thats the kind of jacket you need in la so im not angry about that   we can mock it but its practical alright so that is item one of eight whats next out of my bag of tricks ooh exciting stuff this is the linen peasant blouse this looks very comfy actually a little similar to a different like peasant shirt that i own that ive worn in a fair amount of videos actually so this is not a terrible pick but maybe not the most exciting pick   no its cute and serviceable for now well see how it fits well see how it fits 
  yeah 
 ooh alright here is another black item i think this is our black tshirt they taped this one seriously   they do not want you to get into that thing why what the actual heck is going on   is it double bagged i dont knowooh this is cute actually i would say online um it looked like slightly underwhelming but actually in person i like the fabric the seam down the middle and the knot detail its a very very conservative version of the hit me baby one more time its like i will tie up my shirt act wear my jeans end okay so next up weve got this lump look ma its a lump   it looks something came out of a vending machine kind of that is totally next up for amazon yes clothing vending machines wow i just gave them a free idea youre welcome all right so heres a cute white wrap top oh  the fronts open 
  oh yeah 
 im flashing myself it is a little business casual and i am pretty much in a place in my life where i have no need for business casual clothing and i think i told them that but you know well see how it looks on maybe it reads a little more casual on the body all right whats next ah i believe these are the leggings whoo the fabric of these is really soft tyler feel this reach out and feel this suddenly its turned into a leggings ad oh yeah reach out and feel this rhonda   rhonda im trying to be like a home shopping network type person now i did tell them that i liked yoga pants and these do feel pretty promising but as a sort of like item that was picked out for me personally by a stylist once again i would say its a little bit of a safe choice   very safe yeah its like im gonna buy a lady in her  yoga pants what we like those thats wild all right so next up we have this gray sweater dress which is very cute i like the neckline and i like these little things around the sleeves but i am a little concerned about the thickness of the knit i thought that this dress might be more of like a where whenever like thin dress and this is definitely a sweater dress like i feel the warmth i feel like they didnt  take into account my location for this one like if i still lived in chicago i would be pleased with this but i dont   something that like a personal stylist should know i mean amazon definitely knows that all right let me roll this thing up and then well move on to the second to last item   the penultimate the penultimate item   oh thats cute whoo i like this pattern   what are those i think theyre stars here let me like unfurl oh   this is definitely your style this is definitely up my alley there are a lot of features on this dress that strike my fancy i like the like fitandflare i do like the sort of um corset neckline situation even if it doesnt look good on me this is probably a good pick like from a online personal shopper i would say that this is a good shot a good  a good stab  i declare cute ow we should get a gavel   we dont need a gavel i need a gavel dear amazon personal shopper dear bezos can you send me a gavel so that is item seven out of eight and then our final item is a pair of shoes and if i remember correctly these are a pair of white studded backless mules   those these are like straight out of the elton john biopic yeah i was gonna say for some reason these are giving me like somewhere in between elvis presley and kris jenner bedroom slippers does that make sense at all   you know you throw some sunglasses on and give her a microphone and i think kris jenner could like be a standin for elvis thats not the worst call its not perfect but its not the worst these shoes are an interesting choice and sort of like a judge on project runway or top chef i have to give them points for trying something  this is not like a sort of neutral white top or great dress this is like a studded  mule so with all of our items desacked lets get them on my body and see how they look  the king kardashian lives so after trying on our eight items there were some hits some misses and some close but no cigars and out of those i would say that there are four items im pretty sure im not gonna keep first being the white linen jacket in general this is quite a comfortable jacket its very light and the cut of it is okay but a white linen jacket just seems pretty hard to maintain so i dont think i would wear it especially since im used to rubbing spills into my jacket rather than off of it   i can already envision like mustard stains on this thing yeah i eat a lot of mustard mustard hot sauce coffee i consume a lot of stainful items like ive said before im a sauce gal thats a problem with the white jacket the second item thats going back to bezos is the black also linen peasant top i feel like my problem with this top is that it is close to a top that i already like so its kind of in like an uncanny valley in between a hill that is i have a top thats like this so i do like this style and another hill that well if i like that top better than i should keep this top the fabric of it is also kind of stiff and wrinkle prone which isnt awesome i feel like with like a peasant top you might want to just be able to sort of throw it on a little bit more than like a shirt you have to like steam and unwrinkle the third item thats getting returned is the white wrap top usually im a medium fan of like wrap style tops but this is an actual wrap top like there is holes in it and like i actually have to wrap it together and it could become unwrapped and then i could flash people so it not only feels kind of precarious but also i dont think it is the most flattering style on me so it is out along with the gray inappropriate for la sweater dress it is warm and comfortable like what im feeling myself like i am liking what im feeling but its fitting me a little bit weird once its on my body   its like a pillowcase maybe it should have been like more body con or just like more flowy  its kind of like inbetween which is pretty unfortunate because i do like the sleeves i like how long they are and theyve also wrapped my wrists or sort of like forearms like a present   theyre slightly mummified what i thought when i saw it mummy meets christmas present besides those there are two items in our haul that im kind of on the fence about one being the black knot detail shirt i actually like this one on   theres not a lot not to like it looks pretty standard it is fairly standard ill be honest but its quite comfortable i really like like sort of like lightweight feel and i do like the knot detail bring it around town i feel like my hesitancy comes from the fact that its kind of plain and it just doesnt feel like something that i couldnt find myself at a variety of other stores but i still might keep it the second item that im not so sure about is the yoga pants these yoga pants are incredibly comfortable sort of like a nice soft teddy bear around my thighs but they are maybe a hair big i think its because theyre not super like hug or theyre not really like rump lifting yoga pants theyre kind of like lounging yoga pants and i prefer at least a little snapback action from my leggings im a little bit disappointed that these are too big because otherwise i would definitely keep these and i am leaning towards returning these and buying these exact leggings in one size smaller it seems like tyler is on team keep though you want a pair tyler   ill take that pair yeah ill buy a smaller pair and youll wear this pair   just hand them over to me i think weve figured it out i think thats what were gonna do and then the final two items of the haul im actually leaning towards keeping the first one of which is this black starry dress alright okay i like this dress   yeah me too this one is definitely one of the more exciting pics from the stylist i would say it is like okay it has details its a dress it has a pattern its got sleeves you know theres something to it   yeah its a garment with a little style and besides the silhouette and the details the pattern is definitely up my alley its a little witchy  a little celestial a little i want to say woman of the night but i know that has different connotations but you know what i mean   yeah like a modern sanderson sister yes sistahs grab your vacuums tonight we fly besides the dress i think we all knew the elvis jenner slides had to be a winner   alright those are a hard keep come on though i have no idea what to wear them with i feel strangely drawn to them in general they are interesting  they are a conversation piece they are out there and even though i would not have picked these out for myself i respect the stylist for going out on a limb to try to show me a new look   they are unbelievable i want these things saf elvis jenner loafers theyre a thing dont look it up so that was our amazon personal shopper haul in general i think that all of the pics were nice quality but overall i would not say i was wowed all of the things they picked out for me it could reasonably be justified by my answers on the quiz but most of them were pretty safe or middleoftheroad selections and it definitely didnt seem like they were trying to show me the range of what amazon has to offer or any upandcoming trends in fact i dont think we saw anything that they said was a trend from that one portion of the quiz and i think when you evaluate what a personal shopper brings to the table you kind of want someone who is better at shopping than you or who knows more about fashion than you do like with rachel green and joeys murse this is a great bag okay and its as handy as it is becoming which may not have been the right choice but hey at least she tried now the service does say that they try to improve their picks as you use it over time but i feel like they could do a better job faster if you could actually chat with your stylist but we never heard from any human at any point   wheres like the personalized note you know like an explanation i would have loved a note  i would have really loved a note i wish i knew who my stylist was alexa just pipes up from the corner it was me interestingly on the faq page for this service they kind of imply that there may not actually be a person styling you and it might all be an algorithm so you may just be paying for a conglomeration of the suggested for you bar im not saying thats definitely whats happening but it seems possible all of that said i wouldnt say the service was terrible it was about the same as any other style box service it just wasnt very exciting which is kind of disappointing given how much weird crap there is on amazon i actually think i would highly enjoy an amazon personal shopper sending me random gadgets i actually might like that more than this but who knows maybe im just salty that i still have hair on my head and i do not have a killer vest thats all i really wanted anyway thank you guys so much for watching if you liked that video make sure to shamash that like button and you want to see more

to another video today we have some bonus wedding content for you  this is the full version of our first dance which was a recreation of the tango scene from the addams family values  what can i say im a morticia stan  now as some of you guys might know we recently posted a full wedding vlog which featured a fair amount of our first dance  but we werent able to put the actual music in because it would get copyright claimed and then like paramount or atlas or whoever would claim our entire wedding video so we decided to post our first dance by itself as a little bonus video here just in case it gets taken down its not taking the rest of the wedding vlog down with it so with that here is our first dance  also quick preface obviously neither of us are trained or prodancers in any way so please dont roast us this was just for fun   
addams family values the original orchestral score
track 8  the tango    so that was our first dance i think it went pretty well there were a few hiccups here and there  i got a little lost in the moment and went for like the second bunsarollin spin so saf lost a little momentum on the ground and had to be like dragged up but we improvised 
 we made it work  we made it work  
 as tim gunn says  overall it was so much fun learning and performing this dance it was definitely one of the highlights of the night for me and i think our family and friends thought it was fun too  there were a lot of shocked faces next up real knives and real backflips  or not   thank you guys so much for watching and once again a huge thank you to our cinematographers amari productions for helping us film all of this wedding content they did get many an angle of this first dance  and another big thank you to the arthur murray studio in montrose for helping us learn this dance if you liked that video make sure to shmash that like button and if you want to see more videos like this well probably not not like this but with us in it  shmash that subscribe button a big shout out to courtney for watching thanks for watching courtney and we will see you guys anext time  hello friends and welcome to our wedding video thats right we are no longer engaged betrothed or affianced  despite how many times youve said that  we are married wedded matrimonied  yes we are  so back in november we got married which we may have spoiled in this instagram post where tyler is wearing his wedding ring  yeah i think some of you guys might have figured it out  and we had so much fun at our wedding it was such an incredible night  that we really wanted to share it with you guys  hence the wedding video hence 
  hence  now weve edited this video to be a little different than like a traditional wedding highlight video mostly because we wanted to show you guys the day from our perspective but also to provide some of our thought process that went into the planning and like the design decisions and stuff because we had a really great time putting it all together and choosing all the things  now before we jump in we wanted to say a huge thank you to our cinematographers amari productions who did an amazing job filming  and also helping make sure that i didnt pick up a camera all day because i was really nervous i was just gonna like grab one and start filming broll of the venue  me too  yeah  we also want to say thank you to our wedding planner marnie at so smitten special events whos been unbelievably helpful the last couple of months  theres not a ton of footage of marnie because she was zipping around doing stuff all night  but youll see her here and there 
  here and there also thank you to all of our other vendors as well for helping make our big day so special  so with that heres what happened on our wedding day  and i guess the best place to start is with us getting ready in the morning i stayed at like a hotel the night before  i was with crusty at home  so that way the morning of all of the ladies like involved in the wedding could get their hair and makeup done in my room it was kind of poppin i had a face mask on for most of it and then around  am dave and the amari productions crew stopped by to start filming all right hello were getting ready were getting ready weve been getting ready for a few hours actually theres been a lot of people in and out you guys are here now other people were here earlier  you had like a caravan of relatives i just had the cat  but we had my mom got her makeup done we had tylers mom get her makeup done we had tyler sister get her makeup done cuz shes the officiant but also because shes tyler sister and then we also got my bridesmaids get their makeup and hair done are my bridesmaids here 
yeah yeah some of them were at target a second ago so i was just checking in but we have the bridesmaids in the house we have kaitlyn somewhere woo from the distance  a distant woo was heard oh also um this is my wonderful glam team i should have started with that its okay this is kaylee melissa doing my hair   hi 
  of decade video fame  and this is yuki whos doing my makeup  hi and i would say in general were going for kind of like a um  and then    who was calling you 
  no one ever told me its just a mystery for the hair we wanted to go for kind of like there is a lot going on theres a lot of hair i think my general hair and makeup goal was just to have something that would match the fantastical meets medieval vibes of my dress and my dad did tell me that i ended up looking like aragorns girlfriend so i think we succeeded were almost done with my makeup i think except for the finishing touch the lips where i shall be wearing one of our colourpop frankenlipsticks   shameless plug its happening its my wedding day its fine no one can tell me no 
  that was uh really smooth  that was uh really smooth  i stand by it my nails also got done not today but christine did them yesterday so its simplynailogical theres actually no good broll of my simply nails here but there is a shot of me picking tylers nose later so keep an eye out for that  that did happen so with my hair and makeup done it was time to do like a looking into the mirror for the first time reveal which i did not anticipate being so emotional because i i pretty much immediately started crying there is a lot of my crying face in this video so just know that  dont worry about it i cry a lot in this video  okay all right thats not what i expected to do ok im fine so after my sob sesh we stuffed me into an uber and headed over to our venue the carondelet house  where i had been basically all day okay so we are here at the carondelet house which is our venue this is like our dude lounge for me and my groomsmen i was supposed to do our first checkin like this at my house and then i got like kind of uh lost in the fray so i had mistakenly go into the carondelet house first and the cinematographers had correctly go into our house first so when they got to our house they thought that i had bailed  runaway groom  i was just overeager but i i feel like this is fine for us to do a checkin here my house is really dirty crusty my cat if you dont know him has been just dragging litter everywhere so its better than were here 
the other dynamic of my morning was that we forgot to give me wedding shoes outright so im gonna trade shoes with my dad for the ceremony and i had to stuff them with toilet paper just to get them to fit hey you know what thats that is gonna help pretty snug now so yeah shoes didnt think about that but wait back up after those two mini fire drills my groomsmen started showing up this one is sean and besides sean we also had ben block my brotherinlaw james and my dad who was actually my best man dad dundundaa shoo  and once everyone was there it was time for me to get dressed and i wore a black velvet tuxedo jacket  looks great im gonna be sweating either way i think just cuz you know the vows and all that stuff theres a lot of lights out there and then as a finishing touch we have a rare marnie sighting here  the marnicle  as i got boutonnieredup so that was my wedding look  looking fly  thank you is this ready to get married now while tyler was downstairs getting dressed i was upstairs hangin with my gang in the bridal suite and i think im about to get dressed i think thats whats on the schedule so lets do it now i actually needed some assistance to get into my gown because besides being pretty awesome  its so cool  it also ended up being kind of fragile that too and of course classic me as soon as i got into it  that too  and of course classic me as soon as i got into it i started getting teary eyed i was just blubbering all day i feel like actually a fair amount of the audience has seen this dress in muslin form we ended up choosing this beaded scalloped patterned fabric which has kind of like an art decomermaid feel to it also i didnt realize this would happen when i chose the fabric but the dress is  pounds i cant tell that its  pounds of just like bead basically just beads and though our fabric was heavy and kind of had a mind of its own i dont regret our choice at all because i really loved how it ended up looking like its inevitable but im gonna try and not crunch while i walk down the aisle so after that we added my finishing touches like my jewelry im just like wheres my ear literally where as well as a gold celestial headpiece as well as a gold celestial headpiece now kaylee and i had a really hard time finding the right one like we were looking for months so she actually ended up making this one herself and it turned out so perfect like she just totally nailed it she did  she did  all right so i think i am generally styled downstairs and see tyler so we decided to do this thing called a firstlook which is basically like a moment before the ceremony so we decided to do this thing called a firstlook which is basically like a moment before the ceremony where the bride and the groom reveal themselves to each other  that sounds wrong  mostly to get rid of some nerves but also so you can like start hanging out together and also take some pictures before the ceremony and also take some pictures before the ceremony im ready oh my god   we are a couple of sad sacks 
  were not good at this  ready whoa  oh wow  we did eventually pull it together  we deblubbered  its kind of crazy to me that we remembered so many little things but we forgot your shoes  to be fair theyre supposed to be on my feet and i didnt even think of them  so after checking each other out the general consensus was that up next it was photo time  so we took a bunch of photos both inside the little atrium area where we had the first look and also outside the front of the carondelet house both with each other and with our bridal party  we had a hard time being serious for these ones cheers hey hey cheers heyheyhey  its like uh beybeyblades  beyblades with that that one came out its an analogy for marriage our photographer alex was very patient with us yeah  was that what im talking about  its an analogy for marriage  our photographer alex was very patient with us  yeah hes a cool guy  its like the tops that fight each other i think its beyblades  yeah ok  well look it up so we filmed this next portion of the video as like the last thing we did before the guests started arriving mostly to quell my own nerves because i really wanted to get footage of everything and i was irrationally nervous that we wouldnt so we did like a tour for you guys of the whole venue but just a headsup it wasnt  set up yet now our general wedding theme was a starry night so we had a lot of stars and moons and twinkle lights going on however because of the rooms near the entrance of the carondelet house are already pretty decorated in like a vintage manner style we reserved most of the celestial trimmings for the back of the house and left this stuff up here kind of as it was and we were kind of thinking of it almost like a narnia situation where these front rooms were like the professors house and then as you venture deeper into the building there was more magic afoot we choose an espresso martini because its brown like crusty and also because its very caffeinated  kind of like a classy four loko  moving on from the front foyers there was this little hallway in between the front of the house and the back of the house so we decided to deck it out and make it like the entrance to narnia and these hanging stars were actually our escort cards so people could figure out where they were sitting for dinner after that there was the first look atrium tylers little lounge situation and then we had our main ceremony space which i would say is the room we tried to deckout the most the other reason i wanted to have this cloudy sky backdrop was that in this main room they actually have like a big nonremovable mirror in the back which i just wasnt sure we wanted as like such a strong focal point of the ceremony and then finally we had this back atrium where our photo booth was gonna go which had like this cool oldtimey moon as the centerpiece and with our photo booth area visited that concluded our tour after that it was time for all of us to go hide upstairs in the bridal suite because our guests were starting to arrive  all right so  no this is not a bit   kaylee has super glue 
  there you go jinx but uh yeah no lets do that  there was just so much going on with tylers shoes i think maybe that was like our charlotte and harry moment like from sex in the city like little things have to go wrong at your wedding  but after gluing my soles together and a few final todos  it was pretty much time to make it official like officialofficial  all right they were just about to walk in im walking down with my niece and my mom so well see how it goes im definitely feeling some butterflies but we got this  now as we mentioned earlier tylers sister was our officiant so she was our first person down the aisle then we had tyler tylers mom and baby ellie then we had the whole bridal party  looking spiffy  and then it was finally my turn to walk down the aisle  welcome everyone please have a seat i know everyone is as excited as i am to be gathered here in la to celebrate the marriage of safiya and tyler  now were actually gonna keep a lot of the ceremony and like most of our vows off of the internet we wrote them ourselves theyre kind of mushy we cried we laughed tyler called himself a dingus  so if you really want to marry this dingus lets do it  its what i wanted to say originally when i proposed so i had to work it in  my vows were kind of all over the place i talked about zombies for a while  that was actually pretty relevant to our early relationship  i exposed some of our intimate secrets  yeah you did  and i will pop your pimples even when they are in unspeakable crevices  aw  but they were good i think  i loved them  besides all of that we did actually want to show you guys this one thing that we brought to the ceremony  safiya and tyler have chosen to affirm their love by the lighting of a unity candle this candle is actually made by safiya and tyler last year while filming a video for their youtube channel and is called their frankencandle  now when our wedding planner asked us if we wanted to do a unity candle we knew that we had the perfect candle for the job so we had to do it  also im sorry guys if it smells like blueberry pancakes in here  its the candle not me  
  its a dominant scent 
  yeah its a dominant scent so after that we cried a little more we did the whole ring thing   and you know the actual marriage part 
  and then  by the power vested in me i pronounce you as a newly married couple you may kiss each other  and that was our ceremony  we were married  were still married  were married  there you go alright so how was that did i cry too much you think  no i dont think you cried too much   no 
  no i thought we got through our vows pretty well pretty well i do  pretty well we had a nice guest appearance by ellie here and there  welltimed welltimed  but i overall i thought i thought it went great  its probably stinking up the place right now  its probably going to turn everyones appetite off are you ok a lil still emotional ok ok lets go take some pictures newly married couple   oh mines like totally off center 
  yeah 
  well figure it out 
  well figure it out  so after that we had to take some family pics before the sun set  and then we went into cocktail hour  now while everyone was in the front foyers for crustinis and appetizers the ceremony space in the back was actually getting flipped into our dinner space  oooooooh yeeaah  looks pretty incredible wow  which we got to get a little peek of for our dinner tables we have like gray velvet tablecloths with black and gold flatware and plates and also little like personalized moons to designate where everyone was sitting and for our centerpieces we had a variety of antiquey vampy library paraphernalia like beauty and the beast style terrariums vintage looking books and mossy florals yes and then we had our sweetheart table at the front of the room which had more of those mossy flowers as well as a lot of black candles but dinner time was quickly approaching  so after everyone took their seats we and our bridal party did like our grand entrance thing  please help me with a huge round of applause as we welcome in our newly married couple give it up for safiya and tyler  i think sometimes people plan stuff for their entrances but we kind of forgot so everyone just did their own thing   i think they might have spilled like directly onto simplybenlogicals head 
  sorry about that ben  but anyway after a little dinner and doing the rounds saying hi to everyone we were onto the toast portion of the evening starting with tylers dad  now i am extremely honored to have had tyler asked me to be the best man so i could give a toast but interestingly enough this is not the first time ive given a toast at a wedding of tyler and safiya now as we all know because we are all loyal subscribers and we all shamash the like button and we shamash the subscribe button   i dont know why everyones laughing i mean i hope theyre all subscribed  they had a wedding in hong kong this summer and at that wedding i gave a very impromptu toast which was not very good safiya was very kind and she said and i quote well that wasnt half bad no it was all bad trust me it was really bad in fact it wasnt even close to the best toast that was given that day the best toast was from our hong kong hosts thomas and winkle and it was apple apple may your hearts be joined as an apple so im extremely happy to have a chance to take a mulligan and redo and see if i can at least get to the level of thomas and winkle  now were not gonna put his whole speech here but i do think he did a great job with his toast definitely got some of the emotional stuff in there  but i think he was also able to like bring a lot of different things into the mix like our macdonalds wedding promoting our channel shakespeare  because as we all know loyal subscribers and viewers safiya is a big fan of shakespeare  we got some henry v a little tempest  and he really got the crowd going  now my dad gave the second toast and as you can probably tell by his guitar he also played a song  let me just say a few words about safiya and tyler of course i have two really wonderful children and now i have tyler as one more guy so were very happy about that hes not really much of a speech guy  hes not really much of a speech guy i would say but i think he did a great job  yeah i loved it  and after that he and my brother played a little cover of yesterday by the beatles but with altered lyrics  ill start by making an apology to sir paul mccartney because we could gonna mess up one of his beautiful songs but well do what we can  my dad actually used to be in a beatles cover band in the  in denmark and i think its been a little while since hes picked up a guitar but recently he and my brother have been like jamming unfortunately we cant actually play their song for you guys because it would get copyright claimed but it was really sweet and i completely lost it basically  yes one more round of applause for the father and brother of the bride  now before we could really let loose as some of you may know we did have this whole change into a black wedding dress choreographed first dance thing on the docket so after the toasts we had to run upstairs because i had to get changed in like five minutes  yes we are in the middle of a costume change the mvp right now cuz yukis touching me up  i really was a mess and besides yuki trying to salvage my face and a little bit of a lipstick change hayley was also pulling my hair back for partying purposes  more aerodynamic  and she replaced my crown with some cosmic pins on the back of my head for like a milky way but made of hair look and once we had at that in order and once i was fully spruced we headed down to the dance floor because it was time to tango so our first dance was actually a recreation of the tango scene from the addams family values now unfortunately that music is also copyrighted so we cant actually play it for you but we did spend a few months learning this routine neither of us are dancers neither of us are dancers so please be gentle with us but we thought it would be fun to do like a performance situation and in addition to the choreo if there were some props some audience participation some toreadoring and some sleight of hand i think i pulled that off as well as this whole move where tyler like spins me around on my butt which may or may not be called the buns are rolling none of our guests really knew exactly what we were going to do so i was pretty pleased that we were able to surprise them with this after that in quick succession we cut our cake which was sadly not the franken cake but was this beautiful allblack cake that may or may not stain your mouth we did like the fatherdaughter motherson dances and also like a giant group photo and then we checked in one final time all right so we just did our first dance and our cakecutting yes a lot of things just happen were both kind of sweaty tylers teeth are a little bit black are my lips also red everything everything but its like purple i was super super nervous for the dance yes i think that all things considered we did a pretty good job yes i think there were like a couple hiccups here and there i went for the second but to roll in spin on the ground well have to film a dance practice video so people can see the full buns are rolling i think what we recovered yes i got angry yeah an entire look dragged me up but it worked and were going to do it and we got the kiss and i think i got the knife in my mouth at the right time that was fun i thought i also have never done it with the lighter and good thing that didnt happen i think its time for us to party and have fun lets do it after that the rest of the night was mostly just partying we hit up that sick good night moon photobooth even though tylers mouth was still a little purple and then we just like broke it down on the dance floor would you say we tore it up yes there was just like an endless stream of go to wedding songs a little shout a little journey a little britney and then we finished off the night with some dancing queen which is always a solid choice and we were just really happy that everyone was there and we just had a really good time so that was our wedding oh also one last thing when i threw the bouquet i accidentally hit one of our editors claire in the face but she has assured us that she still had fun so were all good on that front a huge thank you to everyone who came to our wedding as well as

like this not really like this make sure to smash that subscribe button a beach out to jade for watching thanks for watching jade and we will see you guys anext time hello friends and welcome to another video this week im gonna be getting a custom black wedding dress yall can stop tweeting me now its happening now as some of you might know i am engaged betrothed affianced and a few months ago we went shopping for my wedding dress and we ended up picking out a really amazing gown with some pretty epic medieval sleeves look at that sleeve ty with a couple of details still left up in the air like the fabric and the final fit but we said sure to the frock and that dress is still gonna be my wedding dress but for a while ive been teasing the idea of doing a white swanblack swan moment and having a second dress that i can change into for the party portion of the evening so that is what were gonna be working on now the odile dress if you will or the mila kunis one unless you think shes just a figment of natalie portmans imagination that movie came out in  i dont know why im still talking about it now the first question some of you may be asking is why do you want a black wedding dress at all well i wear a lot of black it started off as like a theater kid stagehand thing yes i was a theater kid no one is surprised and that predilection has now taken over my life and closet entirely so a black wedding dress is definitely in my wheelhouse in fact some of you were surprised when i chose a white dress at all now my line of thinking this whole time has been like if theres one occasion in my life to wear a white gown this is it and i really love the juliet dress that we chose as well as the fabric we ended up picking out for it however unintentionally the fabric we settled on is gonna end up being pretty heavy and a bit fragile and for some insider info tyler and i are planning a somewhat intricate choreographed first dance so i pretty much definitely need some kind of second dress to boogie in so i thought why not a black one the second question you guys may have is why custom now there are a lot of black gowns like out there in the world but when it comes to choosing a second wedding dress i kind of want something that would both complement the first dress stylistically but also not upstage it or downstage it too much so kind of a tall order but thankfully through our shopping process for our first dress we were able to meet the designer of it stephanie white of odylyne the ceremony and when she heard i was looking for a black wedding dress to complement our juliet gown she was intrigued and she thought it could be really fun to work on something custom together so i said yes to working on a custom dress and thus began our journey so to start off we hopped on an initial facetime call with stephanie to kind of game plan alright hi stephanie how are you doin okay so leading up to this call i had started pinning stuff to a shared pinterest board as well as sharing stephanie on our general wedding one just so she could get a feel for the vibe we were going for now our general wedding theme has kind of evolved a little bit initially i was describing it as a midsummer nights dream in autumn with kind of like christmas lights and exposed brick but its sort of grown into more of a starry night concept as weve added a lot of decor with moravian stars moons and twinkly accents ive like pinned a bunch of like celestial patterned fabrics um i dont know if theres like that possibility out there so most of the dresses i was gravitating towards were more on the whimsical side with like beading or sheer layers you know just things that had some etherealness to them theres also a fair amount of these sleeves that are like almost like the opposite of a bell where theyre almost like theyre poofy and then they cinch at the wrist so those are super cool also so with some of my ideas out of my head and onto pinterest the next question was how we were gonna turn those pins into a dress what is our plan of attack so our next meeting would be in person to see some of these sketched out silhouette options that stephanie had cooked up from our conversation and then choose one of them that sounds perfect so i will see you next week all right see you soon bye now joining us for our sketch reviewing session was christy baird who some of you may remember as the owner of loho bride who helped us pick out our first dress and was also the one who linked us up with stephanie in the first place and we were all gonna be taking a gander at three different silhouette options so here is look one which we talked about sleeves cause we know youre sleeve girl yeah i am im a sleeve lady look 1 is a generally fitted silhouette that hugs the abdomen and then starts to flare out below the hip with sheer poufy sleeves and a plunging deep v at the cleave  point something to show off a little of chest hair just a little bit  look 2 is somewhat similar to look one in that the sleeves are also sheer and voluminous and cinched at the bottom i feel like both of them have this like cool like gatheredness which i really like but instead of being fitted look 2 has some shearing at the waist to provide more of an aline skirt it also has a deep v but its covered by a high necked sheer overlay sort of similar to these looks that stephanies designed look 3 is very different from the other two wow this one is giving you that whole princess fairytale vibe yeah this design is off the shoulder with a notch neckline and an aline skirt and theres that sleeve detail playing off of these dresses that i had pinned and also this one that i tried on way back when at loho and liked but didnt end up picking it would definitely give some drama like they would definetly fly around a little bit for sure and honestly after seeing them i thought that all three of these sketches were really awesome and did hit a lot of the things that i had initially been pintrested in  but i had to make a choice and right off the bat i had a couple of concerns with option number 3 specifically that it would not really solve our problem of needing a more practical dress for dancing purposes with both the off the shoulder being restrictive to my upper arm mobility a lot of my girls that do off the shoulder do it for ceremony cause they want the photos not a lot of people going the other way as well as the cape sleeve situation that i so loved potentially getting in the way like you might be like twirling through your own sleeve that might happen regardless but like i feel like lets not make it harder for me so we decided to nix dress number 3 which left us with options 1  2 now the differences between these sketches mainly come down to the neckline of which dress  is quite high im nervous about like this kind of thing getting covered yeah i dont know not getting covered but im worried about like i dont know somethin well in dancing too on the flip side are you gonna be warm with something up this high and besides any potential double chinning the sheer overlay would also obscure the deep v which i actually thought could be a good idea to highlight because it would mirror the neckline of my other dress so wed have that kind of continuity going now between the two skirt silhouettes i usually favor more flowy ones but i was actually surprisingly drawn to the more snug style im down for that i could be up open to a booty moment absolutely you see the booty hump so between these two which one feels like the frontrunner so all things considered i would say that style number 1 has that practicality for dancing with some dramatic flair without things flying around so it seemed like the perfect choice weirdly i cant say that i like knew that this dress existed but i feel like this was kind of in my head so we decided to go with that one amazing okay this is good im excited and the next step after choosing our silhouette was to have stephanies pattern maker whip up a muslin version of our dress for me to actually try on alright so we are here back again at loho bride and today were gonna be meeting up with stephanie and her pattern maker rita to take a little sneak peek at the muslin of the black reception dress now a muslin is essentially like a prototype version of a dress that you can use to finalize the pattern before you make it in the final fabric i cant wait to get into it so i popped into the dressing room to see how it was looking for just a rough draft i honestly thought the dress looked pretty spooktacular and i think a lot of the details that we had focused on in the sketch were looking good irl i like this shape and i love the sheer sleeves and the v i like a lot of things yeah im so happy about that because i like a lot of things too stephanie and rita had some standard fit alterations they wanted to make you feelin rock and roll definitely so they pinned me up in a variety of locations that is correct for my part i only felt like we needed to make small tinkers to the silhouette like making the waistband more narrow and maybe exaggerating the sleeves slightly so i told them to really go for it in terms of sleeve poofiness yeah go big and then go home the other thing that we needed to adjust was the length of the skirt i wanted to make sure that we couldnt see too much of my shoes from underneath the dress so im wearing like straight up like jazz shoes for like dancing purposes but at the moment there was a beautiful fullon train behind me and unfortunately i think it had to go for the sake of our tango yeah i dont think we can have any train otherwise i think im gonna trip on it yeah or hes gonna trip on it someones gonna trip on it but besides those tweaks we were fired up for our frock awesome i like it yeah i really i dont just like it i love it and with our final silhouette within reach it was time to pick our fabric spirit fingers i guess i dont know now originally stephanie had thought that something like a black velvet could be good for our gown and she had actually found a couple of swatches of different velvets that she showed us on our sketch reviewing day i keep petting this one i feel like these feels like youre gonna get petted i know however we had already chosen a velvet tuxedo jacket for tylers wedding outfit and i was kind of nervous about clashing so we took her swatches to tylers tux place to compare and none of them really matched yeah i feel like unless it matches perfectly its not gonna make sense yeah no i cant and with velvet more or less nixed stephanie suggested that we all go fabric shopping together so we could see a lot of different black fabric options in one go and then make our choice so we met up one afternoon with two fabric stores on our itinerary rag finders and mood alright so we are here at rag finders in downtown la ready to search for some fabric for our dress basically rag finders is like a deadstock fabric emporium which means that all of these fabrics are like no longer in production theyve ended up here and they will not be making any more of them i swear i have a dress from urban outfitters from this fabric this could be that fabric so if you find something that you like grab it and run well pay first but yes grab it pay and then run so im gonna be meeting stephanie here as well as sarah who works at rag finders whos going to be helping us explore adventure quest navigate navigate is a good word shes gonna be helping us navigate this place i can hear them on the uh on the mics it said did we lose them a little bit a little bit because its large and labyrinthy you could see me holding my eyeballs in my hands i dunno in all seriousness though rag finders is super cool and there are a lot of hidden gems there look at this blue camo print i could make you a pair of joggers out of that youll look like one of the cheetah girls and we decided to start our expedition in the lace room upstairs through a crevasse in terms of laces we were looking for something with a semi gothic vibe without looking too tableclothy or too floral you got to do this with all the fabric so i can kind of see them you can just cocoon me inside of them so cobwebs were in i like it cuz its kind of spider webby and its pretty geometric which i also like a lot its kind of wicked but fruits were out yeah youre right and it does look like a pineapple pineapples just make me think of fibonacci numbers which makes me think of sixthgrade math and stephanie also wanted a fabric with some heft to it i dont like yeah no i dont think so its not thick enough for me we need a we need a beefy fabric here wheres the beef and after pulling a fair amount of fabric rolls out of the depths i dont know how to get in there and then having to put them back where we found them im like jousting put em up ty im jousting with you we gathered a few possible lace options and then decided to head over to another part of the store all right squeeze suck it in squeeze it suck it in a metaphor for putting on spanx but on our way over there sarah did spot one last lace now our first dress fabric is a beaded scalloped pattern with eversoslight art deco vibes so i had kind of been keeping half an eye out for scalloped patterns in the lace room wait this ones actually awesome this ones kind of really awesome this is really awesome so sarah had done good good find sarah is the bane of fabric stories  i was born in the fabric store unfortunately though once we pulled it out  we realized it was too narrow of a bolt to actually cover my body so it was a nogo but maybe we can like take a little for inspo or something yeah still on the hunt we headed downstairs past more mountains of fabric to the jacquard area to try and see if we could find anything sparkly or patterned with kind of a celestial vibe we did end up finding one shimmery metallic fabric that could have been an option but none of us were really feeling it i think its not right okay there we go i dont think so thats why we do it and without finding a clear frontrunner i mean it would be red hot hahaha we decided to say auf wiedersehen to rag finders and head over to our second destination mood of project runway fame im try to remember all the things that tim gunn says i dunno i think he just says lets go to mood yeah right alright time to go to mood thank you mood yes now beyond that mood is more of a standard fabric store with just a wide range of options this ones kind of funny not for the dress but just in life and so we inevitably found a lot of things that were not gonna work with interesting patterns is it like vaguely animal printesque the subtlest of cheetah prints as well as textures oh theres feathers over here oh theres a lot of feathers over here but something that mood did have a fair amount of was good sparkly options oh wow thats really nice actually now i was down for some sparkle but we did have to be careful with beading because we didnt want anything that could snag in a dancing situation especially during this move the bunsarollin where tyler spins me around on the ground and though we did end up finding a couple of good options its kind of cool yeah i dont foresee these falling off stephanie had to secretly found a treasure in the corner that she was eager to show me get ready get ready get ready i dont know if this is right but like which was a sheer black fabric with embroidered stars oh wow its pretty awesome its pretty awesome right that is pretty sick guys and though i had kind of given up hope of finding a celestial patterned fabric like this it was one of the things that was all over my initial pinterest board and theyre not like stars where theyre like oh theyre stars theyre little abstracty stars you know it was very different from all of the other options that we had considered this is really good but it was light seemed easy to dance in and would match so many other elements of our wedding that it really felt like a winner i mean kind of like out of all the stuff that weve chosen this is definitely you yeah i think so too i think this could be the one honestly i think thats also like the first time ive like felt that way good and having checked out so many different fabrics from velvets to pineapples to fire trucks it felt kind of surreal to finally find something we liked so much alright this is pretty awesome is that a saying is that a thing no i dont think thats a thing so we decided to go with this one i guess that was a resounding thank you mood thank you mood and with our material and our silhouette chosen it was time to put the whole thing together and do a fitting in our final fabric ready and right away we were pretty pumped with how it was looking love it and with how it was twirling no i was ready but i want to see it again okay now there are a couple of things in this more final version that are kind of new to the design oh wow first of which is the sleeves which originally were gonna be made out of a plain black organza but after stephanie went home with our starry fabric and kind of hung out with it for a second she suggested that we instead do the sleeve in our fabric just unlined i think it was a great decision to do the sleeves in the same fabric as the dress we also slightly changed the opacity of the bodice to feature our stars more prominently which actually nicely matches the sheerness of the first dress as well besides those changes i was also quite pleased with the added volume in the shoulder area as well as the snugness on my behind sorry i just like i panned right to your butt crash zoom to your booty but it wasnt so snug that we couldnt still boogie a little lets get your buttsarollin right buttsarollin sounds better all of the details aside though i think this dress was without question just a hundred percent the right dress i feel like this is so you and you know and basically we nailed it and i think we were all really happy with it completely its an extension of the main gown and i just think its stunning yeah me too love it now as you guys could probably tell over the course of this video this dress making process took quite a while and frankly between this dress and our first dress weve been working with stephanie and christy and all of their partners basically all year its been such a great experience to get to know them and work with them and im so grateful that they were willing to let me be so involved in the design process from the initial sketches to the dungeons of rag finders you guys are full gollum right now youre literally finding the ring of power in the darkness im super excited for both of the dresses that weve made together and i cant wait to show them to you guys in the next episode so lets get our buttsarollin and get married thank you guys so much for watching and once again a huge thank you to stephanie for making this beautiful dress i am so excited to see how it if you liked that video make sure to shamash that like button and if you want to see more videos like this make sure to shamash that subscribe button a big shout out to sunthealpacaman thanks for watching sunthealpacaman and i will see you guys anext time hello friends and welcome to another video this week were gonna be baking a wedding cake with every possible cake flavor in it perfect for the bride who wants it allliterally now as some of you may know  besides being engaged betrothed and affianced i am also a bit of a mixing fiend having previously mixed together many of my makeup products hundreds of lipsticks nail polishes and candles so naturally given our nuptials this fall we wanted to see if we could do a wedding themed frankenexperiment and a few months ago one of you guys sent to me a tweet that got the hamster wheels in my mind awhirring a franken cake you say i was intrigued now a question you might have at this point is just what does it mean to make a cake with every possible flavor well the expected answer and how we usually do our franken videos would be that we would mix every batter together into one mixture and then make a single cake but following the trajectory of our pseudo science videos getting increasingly crazy and notably large and also borrowing some inspiration from the reality tv classic cake boss we felt like we had to bake something a little more grand so we decided that for our franken wedding cake every single flavor should get its own layer and thus the idea of a many tiered giant cakezilla was born its time for some bad culinary science yall except this time there wont be lipstick in the cake unless we accidentally drop in some of our colourpop franken lipsticks which are back in stock now at colourpopcom weve got our six colors and our full collection kits all back just in time to add a little batty cheer to your holiday season perfect for anyone who wants some nightmare with their christmas yes its still october in my heart no all right now as for how were gonna make this thing one thing to keep in mind is that were not great bakers let alone bakers of cake monstrosity so were not gonna bet on this getting to our actual wedding in fact we do have a backup cake purchased but we are gonna try our best to make this bad boy as legit as possible so weve recruited our friend and baking expert rosanna pansino to help consult us on how on earth to make a giant cake without it destroying itself and also us all right so we are here at ros house ros been briefed you know like the idea of the vibe can you help me i hope so i thought about it a lot in theory how one would assemble this cake so it would be structurally sound and you could get a lot of variety both of those things sound good i think structurally sound is something that is weighing on my mind a little bit i feel like it could easily end up like what are those ladies called the goth fairy godmothers from sleeping beauty and their cake just kind of like falls over i see that i see that happening for me now wedding cakes are traditionally made in like a tiered structure where each tier gets smaller as you go up for stability now a tier is for cake layers put together and you ice them and thats a tier and conventionally if each layer is 1 inch tall with frosting in between them now how many tiers can you make a cake  thats the question 
 whoo now obviously we want to make a cake with as many layers as possible to fit as many flavors as possible but there are a couple of things to keep in mind one is that they only make circular cake pans so big and so small so were going to be limited by like literally what is purchasable the other limitation is the size of our ovens the ovens in our house are kind of small so were planning on renting industrial ovens for the big boys but even they have their limits so it seems that our largest pan size is gonna have to be  inches wide and the smallest 4 technically goes to a three inch but i would stop at a four inch because a three inch cake is a lil baby  its basically a cupcake 
 and if the size of the pans increase two inches at a time well have eight tiers in total so basically we are gonna be able to have  different flavors which is obviously not every flavor imaginable but when it comes to conventional wedding cake flavors  its a good chunk of them 
 i got you a list of different flavors that you could pair together thank you now in terms of which flavors were gonna use we have two main objectives to have as diverse of a cake as possible looks wise and taste wise and also to pick cake types that could support layers above and below it which unfortunately rules out like mousses souffles tiramisus or flans great cakes but not very stackable to highlight the different flavors as well were also gonna be making corresponding frostings to go in between the layers  whoa 
 so you have like the true frank and cake experience and once we decorate it like a wedding cake were gonna be tasting the cake as tiers as well as figuring out a way to taste all  flavors at once do you think that sounds too crazy its definitely an intimidating undertaking okay but i think after talking with ro we at least have somewhere to start all right so after having ordered an ungodly amount of cake pans grabbing all of our ingredients and prepping some stuff we are ready for our bakea thon so basically today we are all hands on deck which means that im gonna be mixing and baking tyler is going to be mixing and baking thats you tyler  oh yeah
 and then our team member mailinh who has been helping us plan this project is also going to be baking  so were gonna be mixing and baking many cakes at the same time 
 you sound like a frog 
 sorry we recently went to vegas for our bachelor bachelorette party so my voice may be shot  may 
 is 
 okay there you go 
 weve rented ovens weve rented fridge and freezers we went to costco  we got like more eggs than anyone ever its a its a production
  were an unlicensed bakery 
 we are super unlicensed the ovens preheated now some of the cakes were gonna be making from scratch but because of the sheer quantity of cakes we have to make there is some cake mix around and by some i mean a lot also as we go were gonna be adding in the extra batter into a sort of slop cup i guess for lack of better term and were gonna make a true franken cupcake out of our extra batter  yeah 
 to put on the top of our giant franken wedding cake and thats how were gonna taste all the flavors at once all right is it time should we start as for the main cake flavors were obviously gonna be including some of the more basic  cake mixes like the chocolates vanillas and funfetties of the world 
 woohoo party and weve decided to use them primarily in the bigger layers at the bottom we do have a large  man overboard 
 new plan bottom layer plastic flavor  now these bottom layers are gonna take a lot of ingredients 
 open the eggs we need the eggs bring the eggs in here so thankfully we have this automatic mixer to do some of the heavy lifting on these big bowls of batter  all right once everythings incorporated ill make it go fast 
 you dont need to make it go too fast i like to make it go fast and once the batters are ready were gonna take the big ones like these down to the garage where our industrial ovens are  oh my god its hot in here 
 and pour them into their appropriate pans  which weve pregreased and parchment papered and then well put them into the oven 
 my hands are like really really sweaty so in addition to the sort of chocolate and vanilla category we have some other bigger layers i feel like one of the mice in cinderella trying to build her dress also with just straightup box mix but theyre a little more fun kind of with flavors like lemon strawberry  pumpkin spice and good old just spice 
 which spice girl are you ty 
 i think im baby spice 
 oh yeah  which one am i 
 i dont know depends what day it is and these of course are also gonna get poured into their giant pans  oh my god guys its neapolitan ice cream 
 as well as stuck into the oven to the oven  alright watch yourself saffy 
 to the club to the oven whoa  which i think tyler might be scared of 
 it looks like the furnace from home alone its got like a face welcome to hell we also have some fun straightup cake mixes in smaller pan sizes as well like angels food cake salted caramel butter yellow cookies and cream and red velvet  well im talking about the cake flavor red velvet 
 look how red  this is actually i didnt know it was that red
 but tylers talking about the kpop group 
 now that is truly some red flavor and the smaller cakes in general are gonna be going in our upstairs non rental ovens these two cakes next to each other give you strong mcdonalds vibes  its like the burger patty and like whats left of ronald mcdonald 
 that makes me not want to eat it now our cake mixes are mostly betty crocker but we do have these two british mixes from king arthur flour  this is kind of like the great british bake off from hell 
 yeah  mary barry wants you to bake a giant cake 
 a frankencake  you fools 
 and these are like slightly more difficult mixes or at least different recipes 
hello why are you what this is this is the recipe tyler just put water in and then put eggs in put the mix in ty  it says whisk together water eggs and oil add cake mix stir until smooth
 okay alright fine i believe you it just looks very 
 its a british box  they drive on the other side of the road okay makes sense 
 editors note it turns out this company is actually based in vermont but at the time we really thought they were british besides those we also have like a large amount of cake flavors that were making by taking plain mixes and then adding extra ingredients  into them like cinnamon peanut butter 
thats definitely not enough 
thats not enough 
 no 
 oh wow 
 and peppermint extract  oh that smells strong that smells like the ladies locker room at a spa 
 and were kind of just adding these in to taste  oh thats good you dont need more peppermint in that 
 you can taste it  give it another hit 
 yeah thats what i was thinking 
 some of these are gonna need food coloring while others will just get their color from there extra ingredients yeah that looks artsy maybe people do have matcha for their wedding cake because then you could say were the perfect matcha we are also gonna be making cake flavors by replacing the water in the box mix recipe with different liquids like orange juice coconut cream hot chocolate and coffee oh thats what i need right now just a lil sniff  oh that was folgers to the face 
 as well as lime juice and champagne 
 are you gonna shoot that off in here  full disclosure i am not very good at this 
 oh  wow that was actually pretty explosive 
 that was good 
 im glad that everyone pointed me in the right direction and were hoping that these more unique flavors like the pink champagne and the matcha  cosmo and wanda aint slick 
 will give us some serious visual impact in the crosssection and then our final few layers are all going to be made from scratch like butterscotch hazelnut almond pineapple and bananas foster okay so many hours boxes and ingredients later weve mixed up  separate batters and weve gotten them all in the oven this is taking my total cake baked number from like four to like   now cakes have also been coming out of ovens were not just leaving them in there 
 okay 
 you got it down you got it  booyah 
 and the ones coming out of our industrial ovens are looking pretty promising oh and then once theyve cooled off enough were putting them in the fridge i feel like theres probably somebody outside casing our house right now and theyre like you know you understand they have like a lot of cakes  now the upstairs oven is a little bit of a different story 
 oh my god oh my god oh my god its crazy over here oh my god its going crazy over here  in general i dont think its a great oven 
 this is this is real this is real this is a real problem but specifically the duo of butter yellow and mint tried to take the house down well it smells minty fresh  it does 
 something about the butter yellow caused it to  overflow into the mint causing then the mint to overflow into the oven 
 the ring of fire now they are baked and the house is still standing but that ones on our list why are you the way that you are cake so now that our cakes are all baked we can move on to our  slop cup which weve been adding our extra batter to all day 
 it looks like rachel greens truffle 
 the trifle 
 yeah ladyfingers cream then beef sauteed with peas and onions  another round of ladyfingers 
 and weve actually filled up three full buckets as weve been baking 
oh it looks weird 
oh yeah  it looks like bacon 
 a little meaty 
 to go into our franken cupcake batter 
 whoa that was pretty gloopy im not gonna lie oh that one looks very appetizing actually all right lets blend these biatches so it actually doesnt look as  unappetizing as i thought it would 
 no 
 i feel like most of our cakes were brown but that like red velvet cake really just asserted its dominance and made it red  it smells kind of minty 
 you did dose it with that peppermint saf 
 yeah i mean i smell mint and like  weirdly maybe banana 
 and then once weve scooped it all into the cupcake pan well take it down to the oven hopefully the last thing to go into the oven ever hopefully the last thing i ever put into an oven im like that baby  you know the baby im talking about 
 so its about  minutes later and our cupcakes are ready they look awesome it almost looks like a venus flytrap with a tongue or like a little bit like demagorgony but well deal with these dudes later for now they go in the fridge but to finish off our night we have to level all of the cakes that weve baked and cooled so that theyre all exactly one inch tall and also flat and our plan is to use both cake levelers which are these kind of cheese wire type situations  yes
 as well as knives for the cakes that are either too crumbly or too large for the levellers and after we level them were gonna pop the cakes out of their pans and then wrap them label them and put them into the freezer so theyre easier to handle when were building which were gonna do tomorrow all right so here we are on our cake building day so were gonna start off by building each tier individually using our corresponding frosting flavors between each layer which weve premade by mixing the appropriate ingredients into a vanilla or chocolate buttercream base and in addition to putting our frosting into piping bags were also going to be using this fancy dancy cake turntable so i can just squeeze that bag and the cake will move underneath me all right lets do this so im gonna start with these nch layer and the one thats gonna be on the bottom is orange chocolate rosanna had recommended that we put cake boards at the bottom of all of our tiers for stability  so im gonna add some vanilla frosting to the bottom of the cake and then just stick it on there 
 just as vanilla ice  was a glue to the music industry in the  
 what the who 
 vanilla icing will be a glue for this  and after that im gonna put the orange frosting on top of our orange chocolate cake 
 oh its coming out ty  and we want the frosting to be pretty thick and even 
 oh  im figuring it out 
 so it can support the layers above 
 this is actually looking kind of decent and then we just start stacking our layers all right  next up is banana 
 the only dynamic to be aware of is that with a four layer tier there are only like three inner frosting locations so one of the layers is gonna be flying solo like our banana cake which is gonna have chocolate cappuccino frosting on top to go with the chocolate cappuccino cake im already interested by this flavor combination  yeah
 and then we have matcha cake and frosting to round out the tier so when we specd out the cake we tried to like sort of distribute the flavors and colors for maximum visual diversity as well as flavor surprise i guess i would say and i think that this tier is definitely gonna be hitting a lot of different taste buds  its like your coffee and your fruit in the morning 
 yeah actually thats right so well see if that strategy comes back to bite us when we taste it but for now lets move on to the nch cake which is sort of like a spicy almost valentines dayish tier because we have chocolate cinnamon  unleash the power 
 red velvet devils food and pink champagne in it  booya
 rock and roll man cake frosting and rock and roll those are my three vices man all right so that is the nch tier down now were going for ten now for this tier we have salted caramel our spawn of satan butter yellow cake our british but not british eggnog one and some coconut on top i feel like this one kind of looks like a filetofish or like a crispy chicken sandwich  yeah
 besides that we actually dont have much in terms of a theme for this tier but it looks and sounds  pretty tasty 
 that looks like the kind of cake you want to take out to a nice seafood dinner 
 you dont even like seafood  i want to date this cake cause im trying to say 
 thats so rude this is our wedding cake all right what is this who am i whats happening this is the ten inch this is the  inch tier now were on to the  so this tier is kind of like a mashup combination of flavors you might find in a tropical climate because you have coffee beans with the mocha cak
 oh shiz yeah im good  and thats a thick one
  its a thick one mr grinch cacao beans with the hot chocolate cake were trying to minimize stabbing in this video minimize stabbing maximize flavor followed by a lime layer and then like a mint mojito on top this looks like a pile of toothpaste but i feel like it might taste good because it smells awesome all right high five i tricked him into that one so now were on to our nch tier and we are starting off with spice this tier is kind of like the professor utonium from powerpuff girls section mainly because theres a lot of spice going on on sugar spice everything nice these are the three ingredients to create the perfect little girl were just missing a little chemical x but we do have some vanilla and some german chocolate to make up for it  how is german chocolate cake different from other a chocolate cake 
 it has an umlaut 
ah its chooklet its cook now im not gonna pretend like ive been killing it with the piping overall im just not like good at this and im getting exposed but i think my forearms are getting kind of tired  so tyler has been helping me out with it 
 your hands are wild right now 
 highfive i know i got you with that earlier but you are not getting me with that now  weve also entered the territory with these cakes were just moving them at all is a twoperson job 
 the papers slippery  all right watch out for the frosting bucket 
 watch out for the clothing so next up we have the nch layers which im deeming flavors you might inject into a donut with some richer notes like a butterscotch and nutella and then some fruity notes like lemon frosting which i guess we may have let saw a little too long oh my god keep going keep going whoa this is a runaway lemon what the hell screw banana time its lemon time whoa and on top of that we have lemon cake strawberry icing  which is not quite as crazy as the lemon one and strawberry cake she got hit by a giant cake but with that one put away  its time for the biggest boy the  incher 
 slide slide slide slide slide 
 you sound like ross 
 pivot pivot now this tier has a peanut butter cake on the bottom that has started to get a little crumbly so were gonna be very careful and were gonna adhere it to the cake board cracks down and then hopefully if we just kind of move on as if nothings happened well be all good a peanut butter frosting that tyler is going to be squeezing because hes been getting pretty good at it  im like entering a headspace with this 
 are you entering a zone 
 yes 
 is it auto zone 
 yes and then chocolate carrot cake and funfetti frosting and cake on top did that work  uh its on 
 and im gonna say the theme of this tier is that theyre all just giant 
 all the way up  all the way up 
 will it fit will it fit yes yes yes yes yes yeah 
 my hands got buttery yeah so with all of our other tiers built and put away were going all the way to the tippy top for the four inchers  oh my god its so cute 
yeah
 its a baby shark 
 in this tier we have cookies and cream  pineapple cake and frosting hazelnut almond cake and then cherry icing which is supposed to pair with our angels food cake layer  we saved it for the top because it is very delicate and weak so were gonna see what happened 
 dont breathe on it  well sorry 
 now with all of our tiers built its time to frost the outside of each one individually before stacking them on top of each other and basically what were doing is first applying a crumb coat of our frosting which is sort of like an initial thin layer then putting them back into the freezer before adding like an exterior final layer of frosting we have enough vanilla frosting in life we have like a paint buckets worth  so like i hope thats enough 
 i dont know how much that is   pounds 
 and i think ive been kind of figuring it out 
 okay does that look crazy or does it look artful  its kind of like rustic looking 
 thats like a wedding vibe right like the barn vibe  this is the stucco facade that no one on house hunters wants 
 they want crown molding though and then once theyre done they go into the fridge for storage the only one that seems to be presenting a problem is the tiny cake because im afraid that if i use my big metal scraper on it itll just like fall over so ive been using a piping bag but unfortunately the frosting is kind of drooping off of it who knew that it would be the fourinch one that would be my downfall so my new plan is to just go at it with my hands  like what if i built it a fortress of frosting and then squished it inside 
 well call it the fortress of solitude 
 yes im going to caress the frosting onto the cake all right guys its time for a rebrand were not selling lipsticks anymore were selling hand massaged frosting thats my new merch item and once the frosting is on we can try to shape it by shaving off the excess  okay
 thats not bad 
 and then use the metal tools to you know make it look artsy  it looks like a bandaged head 
 i was gonna say looking the invisible man
 okay so with that we are done building and frosting all of our tiers so the only thing thats left to do is to put them all on top of each other and build our final cake which were gonna do tomorrow because we spent all day doing this so good night again and see you in the morning which is right now now how we stack the tiers is actually pretty important because as ro let us know no matter how much good  baking weve done if we dont have the right support the cake might not survive 
 now for structure  lets talk structure 
 as we mentioned we have a cake board at the bottom of each tier which sneakily has like a little circle cut out at the center so what were gonna do is use a big mama dowel or big stick  this is probably the most dangerous part 
 and essentially thread all the layers on to it were also going to be using complementary smaller dowels in each individual tier  which were going to be measuring to the height of our tiers chopping 
 whoa  i mean business 
 and then sticking in 
 and the reason you do that is because when you stack on the other layer on top the dowels will support the cake board so that your cakes dont just kind of like squish into each other yeah they dont end up like stacking cakes and what we found on the internet is that you should use the diameter of the cake divided by 2 number of dowels in each respective tier i have like a large wad of frosting right here how did i get there  i dont even know its like very early on in the day and now we do this seven more times 
 whoa its a minty surprise  it seems like it should get easier as you keep going because the cakes get smaller 
 ha ha ha ha ha sharkbait ooh ha ha but handling like a tower of cakes is kind of terrifying  especially when the top layer will just not cooperate 
 its not heavy enough so gravitys not like doing that much work right now oh no this is your final boss saf im like lliterally screwing the top on i should have known it would come to this all right i think thats on it looks like a man it looks like the michelin man but a cone and together its coming in at an impressive  inches tall which means that the frosting is accounting for a full  inches of height  in fact that might be the most impressive part 
 it looks like the burj khalifa  i mean its basically the burj khalifa of cakes 
 so its the burj cake lifa yeah  nailed it in the corner 
 not terrible not the worst we still have our cupcake that needs to go on top and also some  decorations that we bought but this is pretty close to its final form 
 update the top three cakes are leaning pretty heavily to the left so um it is living up to its inspo of the leaning sleeping beauty cake were gonna try and make a little shim out of cake board and put it right here because its this layer thats like leaning them all over that actually is doing something put a flower there yeah while we were stacking them we tried to put our cakes on as evenly as possible  but theyre still wanting to lean 
 all right now its this way 
what if we shim right here 
 right in the front 
 yeah its like were feeding a monster  it seems like the shims are helping but i still think wed better add our finishing touches a fast 
 ty you film the whole time in case it falls we need every camera on it  so were gonna stick our franken cupcake on top as well as a little custom cat bat cake topper 
 hes roosting  hes looking pretty good safiya 
 we also ran sacked a local joanns so we have some spooky flowers ribbons and buttons that we can stick on there as well oh oh yeah oh my god its cute as hell and with our extra decorations its kind of giving off a sweet but ghoulish vibe which im liking a lot it is even with our shims sort of continuing to lean this general direction right now i think with all of these sort of like spooky decorations its sort of tim burtonesque it is looming over the ground 
 now were getting pretty close to actually tasting our franken cake and weve been coordinating with rosanna to have her come over so we can reveal our creation to her and she can try it with us however were all pretty terrified that this cake is gonna fall over before she gets here so im just gonna hold it just to be safe im literally just babysitting this cake right now 
  minutes  ro says 
 i think this cake has made us its bitch 
 okay guys rosanna is here 
 hey ro  welcome to our clean house 
 oh my gosh im so excited  also nervous 
 rosanna im nervous im holding this cake for dear life 
weve done everything we need to do with this thing so its time to see what she thinks as our baking guru this is our extreme h ouse makeover thing weremove that bus this is amazing i see the cake plates and this is  are you holding it together 
 at this point yes my hand is really crampy but its here and youre here  so im happy but i think to actually slice it were gonna have to disassemble it 
 yeah yeah were moments away from disaster now people actually do this with normal tiered cakes like you have to take it apart to eat it  so i think its in our best interest to deconstruct it now 
 look at all the support nice  you guys  we did our best  
 if you didnt do support you wouldnt even a got to here 
 and once the cake is completely and safely disassembled we can actually cut some slices out of them and try them  you do have to use some muscle to cut these bad boys 
 im shaking im literally shaking 
 her hand is shaking yeah  dont scare me like that 
 but the cross sections of the slices are coming out looking pretty bomb dot com 
 yeah beautiful  that looks so good 
 except for the poor angels food cake which seems to have gotten squished i think the angel food may have just absorbed frosting so with all of our slices sliced its taste test time taste the rainbow if you will now ro actually doesnt know whats in any of these cakes  no
 so im interested to see what you think  the layers taste like 
 so were gonna taste all of our tiers before we try our franken cupcake 
 look at this  starting with our  inch hearty traditional tier 
 oh my god thats amazing its really good  thats so good what the hell 
 its really good 
 what do you taste 
 i can see this is like some funfetti 
 dont look  any flavors coming out at you 
 the aftertaste is chocolate for me  i taste peanut butter carrot only 
 really 
 it was peanut butter thats thats a peanut butter cake at the bottom  thats why its so messed up because i put too much peanut butter in there 
 regardless if this one tastes more like  
 chocolate or like peanut butter its pretty good and tyler agrees 
 that is awesome you went ham with the peanut butter and overall a lot of the sections of the franken cake do actually taste really good in particular the  nch spice and everything nice tear is a real winner 
 oh my god those are amazing  that ones so good 
 its kind of just like a cocktail of holiday goodness 
 oh it just tastes like christmas  its like you just shotgun a gingerbread house 
 oh yeah 
 and despite all of the headaches its caused me the fourinch tier is also quite nice  that was pretty good 
 the flavors arent a hundred percent on the same power level as each other but what you can taste tastes pretty good i think what i tasted was the cookies and cream and the cherry frosting actually now as for the rest of the tiers  there are a couple that are not bad but flavorwise are a little uneven like our  inch pastry filler tear 
 whoa  strawberries oh lemon or is that lemon its not strawberry no its strawberry lemon 
 i agree with ro whoa strawberry then lemon then nothing  the  inch chicken sandwich looking tier is also a bit questionable 
 oh my whats that 
 okay its not terrible  its weird 
 with the primary taste ending up being the caramel cake and the eggnog frosting caramel lots of caramel eggnog  shes right 
 ro has had a moment of clarity 
 shes right 
 what 
 yeah yeah yes yes star baker what what star baker the other tier that is confusing is the sixinch fruit coffee and matcha in the morning cake actually its growing on me i actually kind of like the combo i think it started off kind of good then it got kind of bad and now its okay  but im not sure that ro likes it 
 i was like  orange oh whats happening 
 but since tylers on my side 
 the matcha is not bad i would actually say that was my favorite part of it i think were out voting ro two to one and putting it in the middle category instead of sliding it down to our third category the cacophonous flavor combinations  unfortunately our flavors found in a tropical climate tier ended up being kind of strange 
that one  tastes the most like a mashup cake of all of them so far
 okay  you broke ro 
 now i dont think it tastes like orange juice and toothpaste but i might just have a high mint  tolerancei do not hate it nearly as much as ro does 
 i hate it  
 because tyler hates it too maybe thats why i liked it now this cake is not alone in this category 
 saf is nopnig out right now 
 as the 8 inch  lusty tier is also not great the cinnamon is the primary cause of ros undoing 
 the aftertaste is so  cinnamony and so like huh but underratedly i think the champagne flavor is the one taking it to funkytown  so the overall taste is like a spicy jello shot 
 im gonna call this cake the choker but hopefully the frankencupcake can wash that away now ro actually doesnt know that its a frankenflavor so lets see if she can give us an unbiased taste what does it taste like all right saf do you want to tell ro  its impossible to guess 
 what it actually is is all of these batters mixed together 
 oh shut up 
 yeah yeah its the franken cupcake 
 oh my god it didnt actually taste bad 
 after trying it myself i think that ro is right its definitely not bad to me it tasted like vanilla cinnamon and lemon but like a little deeper  not too sweet and tyler is actually a pretty big fan  little bit of matcha 
 there is like a depth to the flavor 
 i think its matcha why am i saying that like i know what im talking about  yeah ro and i know  
 it does 
 just as a final test we also mashed up pieces of our cake into a single spoonful or franken bite which tyler tried and seemed to like im sensing nutmeg nutmeg mint  maybe a little lemon 
 so there you have it it tastes like something and a hint of lemon so with a pretty definite sugar crash inbound that is our franken wedding cake now im guessing this video is not going to end up being short but regardless it wont actually reflect just how many hours this cake actually took to make i think all in it probably took about  waking hours of egg cracking and hand mixing frosting and moving things in and out of industrial freezers  did anyone see that 
 but in the end i think we came out with one heck of a cake im not sure this thing is gonna make a cameo at our wedding mostly because our hands have been all up in it i cant promise you i havent touched every part of this cake so it probably wouldnt be kosher to give it to our guests but we now have frozen franken cake and frankly ingredients for years so there will be many future sugar crashes to be had by us and our hardworking team at the hands of our creation once again a huge thank you to ro our baking sensei without whom this franken cake would have become a russian nesting doll and also a huge thank you to tyler for agreeing to get all of our cake smashing impulses out now and not on our wedding day  alright were not doing that again 
 no

welcome to another video today were going to be trying on five historical wedding dresses because i wanna play
dress up just a little now as some of you might know i am engaged betrothed affianced am i going to say that at the beginning of every wedding related video probably and tyler and i are in the midst of planning our own wedding which by the time this video goes up may have already happened were in the last couple of weeks of wedding planning over here its fine im fine but while weve been
planning our own wedding the fashion history enthusiast
inside of me has become has become more and more curious about weddings through the ages and specifically wedding
dresses through the ages because everyone knows
the best part of the wedding is the dress sorry tyler the marriage
part is good too now people have been getting married for a very long time since pretty much the
beginning of civilization to consolidate resources
and secure inheritance for love well mostly the
consolidate resources part but also love and what
people wore to their weddings throughout history has vary greatly based on cultural traditions and
changing fashion trends like an ancient rome brides
used to wear yellow veils to represent white and warmth and in medieval europe
blue was a popular color for wedding dresses
because of its association with purity and the virgin mary ive got a lot of these
kinds of facts up my sleeve in tang dynasty era china people used to wear
green to their weddings see i told you so i thought it would be interesting to try on a few vintage and or vintage replica wedding dresses
probably from eras a little more recent than ancient rome to get a peek into the wedding traditions and fashion trends of the time now to do this we chose five eras that we thought had fun and different wedding dresses to try on and just a disclaimer because there are so many different kinds of wedding dresses out there in the world we decided to focus on mostly
western wedding dresses from the last  years also because we wanted to use authentic like actually vintage wedding dresses most of them are no longer
tennis sneaker white in fact theyre mostly cream because well they old and to not drag these
old wedding dresses out and about los angeles we decided to get a legit filming space
just to protect them so we are here on this
white cyc in the studio just fyi were here now to help us achieve our historical wedding dress dreams we recruited a couple of professionals to collaborate with us someone to help us source the dresses this is olivia who is
our costume designer these are also some of
the dresses back here so dont look at them its a surprise
 block them out yeah yes as well as someone to help us finish off our bridal looks and this is cici whos
gonna be doing the hair and makeup today there are a lot of wigs
prepped to my left were going to wig out   lets get wiggy with it  thats not bad
 yeah   i like that and once we had everything
prepped and ready to go it was time to get bridalfied our first dress took us all the way back to the late victorian era the  to be specific for a seriously poofy
sleeved bridal moment i right now feel a little
bit like the murderous bride at the end of disneys haunted mansion till death do us part  we decided to start
with the victorian era because its when white became the goto bridal color for dresses as queen victoria herself set the trend by wearing white to her wedding in  now that said for the
better part of the era white fabric was still
kind of hard to come by but by the  improvements
in the textile industry had made it a little more
affordable for the general public so all of the dresses besides this one are like authentic vintage
from the time period we could not find an
 dress that would fit my  frame so this
dress we did construct and we did make it a
little creamier colored rather than just like stark white just so looked a little
closer to  years old now for this look we
went with a full length longsleeved highnecked wedding gown with a band at the waist and lacey ruff as well as a white
bouquet with some foliage and a long classic tulle veil all right i think im
gonna deveil myself   do you need a hand oh avoid the boom mic
avoid boom mic and  keep going   medium success  keep going   good thing we dont have to do this on our wedding day  keep going overall i think this look
is actually pretty awesome i am a big fan of interesting
and dramatic sleeves and i feel like this is
definitely one of those   it looks like youre wearing pool floaties a little bit  i feel that vibe these giant poofy dudes
came back into fashion in the early  and were
called legofmutton sleeves which yes got their name from the shapely buttocks of a sheep and were meant to be sort
of a menswear inspired look   its almost like
rendition of the travel pillow where you just sleep on top of it  you mean i could just
take a nap on my sleeve perhaps like this
 yeah  i guess i could yeah   just throwing out ideas here  no its not the worst idea youve had  hammacher schlemmer is considering it sharper image is considering it sears said no the victorian era was known for quickly and constantly changing silhouettes but they all pretty much
had the same intended goal of showing off just how
much fabric you could afford and making your waist look small i am not currently wearing a corset i am wearing spanx the modern corset so that is making this dress situation probably a lot more comfortable for me as for my makeup well im
not wearing a lot of it which was reflective of
the victorian perspective on makeup in general you didnt want to look painted you dont want to be a painted woman   you didnt want to look
like youre tricking anyone into thinking that you were
something that you were not  that was the  version of take her swimming on the first date a lot of womens still
used beauty products but since buying and
applying makeup in public was a big nono a lot of makeup and skincare was diy so you have things like
homemade toner and rouge and even homemade eyebrow pencils made by burning cloves that is on fire  it is on fire  sort of like a vintage instagram hack or a troom troom video need to fill in your eyebrows its not a problem anymore the hair of the period
was sort of the opposite of the makeup as it was very
done up and clearly effortful oh my word and for ours we went with a curly style piled on top of the
head with a few tendrils cascading down the back   slight mullet
vibes at the current time  theres nothing wrong with mullet vibes now just like a mullet
is business in the front and party in the back the victorian era was austere to begin and started getting a little
more fun near the end in fact the  were
dubbed the gay  which at the time translated to fun  as the strict social
codes of the time loosened and women started doing
more things outside of home i mean just look at how
much fun theyre having theyve got like an obstacle course going weddings also became more fun as celebrations evolved
from somber church affairs to like actual parties that
you would have at your house with food and games and
maybe a little dancing i could really nail a
chicken dance in this thing   you would crush it  im crushing it right now even half assedly im crushing it probably not a chicken dance though i cant say that for sure apparently throwing shoes at the newly married couple was also a fun  wedding tradition but since i didnt want to ruin my dress or get a black eye we
stuck with some rice   all right grab a little more   thats what im talkin about  that was a good throw   theres some in your hair  yeah thats why we did this last all right now were
gonna have to vacuum that but i would say it was worth it now for our next look bye   see ya  we jumped forward about  years so it this is my  bridal look i thought we had to try on a  dress because pretty much everything about the  fashionwise and otherwise was completely new its by the end of the h century social codes had started to loosen by the  of corset was off with the emergence of the newly
independent flapper girls hitting the town and the speakeasies in their short hair and short hemlines and flop or fashion it definitely bled into bridal fashion as you can see with my
scandalously exposed ankles   its extremely inappropriate  i would have highly offended the previous version of myself as well as my great gatsby
style dangly jewelry   i think that the earrings make you look pretty
ready to like gallavant around long island sound   east egg west egg  is that what
 whatever egg it is  hard boiled egg yeah  hard boiled egg i am safiya of hard boiled egg besides a shocking ankle reveal our look included a loose
longsleeved lacy dress theres not a low waistline theres no waistline tstrap shoes pantyhose
a halfmoon manicure a large gathered veil
and a lacy headpiece in general i am loving this look i love the little hatcrown situation and also oh my god   veil down veil down  head gear was a pretty key
element of the  look and many brides incorporated that into their wedding day oftentimes pairing it with very long juliet capstyle veils this is like sort of an interesting mix of like a crown and like
a small  like hat its like a trident on my head now the clear elephant in the
room is the giant bouquet this bouquet is so big and heavy  i dont know what to do oh my god im nervous its gonna like drag on the ground  bouquets were often very large just need like a firm grip on it   yeah its pretty girthy with cascading details like ribbons bows and
or even more flowers   its kind of like
a ball and chain right  interestingly enough in
the  engagement rings were referred to as handcuffs   i will abstain from
saying anything   no just kidding
 watch it  no just kidding  banks closed so i sort of took turns holding it and not holding it because
i wasnt quite prepared for the sheer mass of it   here we go lets see oh thats weighty thats weighty thatll
get your forearm strong  yeah  forget the shake weight thats all you need right there  now for the face the trend in the  was pretty much the complete opposite of the victorian era as women started embracing makeup publicly for the very first time  all the makeup was a bit rounded the eyes were rounded the cheeks are rounded even the lips were rounded
into that cupids bow look  the movie industry was booming and whereas actresses had previously been considered women of illrepute silent movie stars were idolized and used as spokespeople
for the burgeoning makeup industry and things
like thin arched eyebrows which stars used to express
emotion without talking wow   theyre skinny  theyre skinty and dark lipstick used
because lighter lipstick would turn out gray on screen all became trends for
everyday women as well my mouth shape looks so different its kind of tripping me out actually and so we couldnt help trying some silent movie acting ourselves   you have acid
indigestion   its that oldschool
peptobismol commercial   yeah no im gonna
give you commercial thoughts   with a variety of props   you just say  or
more on your car insurance but you dont even know what a car is  no there were cars hey   hey wait i cant hear you  oh thats a  version of shook  besides the makeup bobbed hair was also a new and thoroughly modern look which many women adopted i think whats interesting to me about the  in general is how just like
everything was subversive   yeah  its like short hair edgy wearing makeup edgy showing your ankles edgy and following that theme
weddings also experienced a bit of a shake up as
courthouse ceremonies and elopements became more
socially acceptable choices another cool thing about
weddings in the  is that ladies started walking themselves down the aisle for the first time which kind of makes sense you need room for the bouquet though despite these new
casual wedding options one has to imagine that
in the roaring  there were still some raging parties   are you doing the carlton  the carlton am i doing the the carlton he asks though i was a little
nervous about partying with my precarious tiara im almost doing like an
irish step dance version of the charleston where im like dont move the upper body and we certainly were not
gonna be doing the carlton   oh oh here it comes and cut  got it  so after exploring the  our next step through history brings us to the  with this jazzy knee length shoulder padded look i feel very like i guess is swanky an appropriate word i feel really like hmm now of course in the
first half of the  people around the world were greatly affected by world war two and wartime had some
pretty dramatic effects on marriage and weddings and fashion i think that there was a
fair amount of variation in wedding dresses in the  depending on when and where and how quickly you were getting married there are some more full
length gownytype situations and then there are some
more casual wedding dresses a lot of people were
trying to tie the knot but didnt have a lot of time or materials with unpredictable
soldiers leave schedules and rationing or the diverting of resources to the military so they have to make do
with what they could for example our dress is more of a sundays best courthouse
appropriate situation i actually really love this dress i love the shoulder pad i love the little like i dont even know what
this is like apron and the belt also is
very nice and cinchie shoulder pads were a common
fixture in a  style mirroring menswear as
women entered the workforce to fill in for soldiers overseas there is also a really
cool thing on my butt what is it its literally a curtain for my booty   just imagine like the mgm lion just roaring right there  exactly
 yes  right out of my butt  besides that we also have an intricate neckline situation going on the  is also when bullet bras and pointy boobed sweater
girls were in fashion so maybe theyre trying to create like a literal just pointy shelf its just like its very its square aside from our dress we also went with some pearl jewelry and also appropriate for the
 half moon manicure a small bouquet of white flowers and an elbow length triangular veil on the back of my head  cause we dont got time for one of those long train veils  aint nobody got time for that   we gotta get to the courthouse  underneath the veil for my hair we went with a sort of variation on victory rolls with a
less of a defined roll shape and more of just like
coiffed volume atop my head with a little carnation on top  ooh shes ready to rock  im feelin it im feelin myself now by the  makeup was no longer the radical statement of a modern woman and had become a staple of
everyday fashion and grooming and the makeup item of
the decade was lipstick its so interesting how lipstick was used as a sign of patriotism in particular the us
government encouraged women to wear victory red lipstick to boost morale and vibrant lip colors were used to kiss letters sent to soldier sweethearts overseas   by the late 
 of women used lipstick  interestingly enough lipstick was also one of the few items that escaped rationing
in the us during the war unlike a lot of the other things you needed for a wedding for instance there wasnt a lot of silk to make wedding dresses out of since they were using that
silk to make parachutes this led not only to
shorter and smaller dresses but also to more diy or handme down ones you wear your friends
dress or your moms dress or a dress that you already had and rationing became a big part of everyday life and culture   apparently if you say hi sugar are you rationed it means are you going steady are you dating someone  ooh you know im about
to be rationed for life   yeah  you didnt like that   yeah i liked it
 i was gonna say  youre the one who has to like it so besides rationing though it seemed like smaller dresses were also popular because they literally allowed you to be more mobile from everything ive read it seems like there were short windows in
time when soldiers were home so literally people
wrote that having a dress that could easily get on a bicycle to go to the courthouse
fast was imperative not only one weddings planned quickly the speed of the wedding
itself was important so your sweetheart didnt get called back to service suddenly before
the license could be signed   you look ready to rock you look like you could be a speedy bride  i feel speedy   you can just jog down aisle  cash me outside how about that i will say that this
dress is more aerodynamic than the previous two me on the bicycle but although the weddings
were supposed to be fast they were also supposed to be fun highlighted with lots of
big band music and dancing you see me with different hair colors like christina aguilera from candyman but unfortunately neither tyler nor i really know how to do the lindy hop  hi  youre sweaty  i can smell you from here   okay okay   its okay dont smell very good either ive been wearing a lot
of old dresses in a row were just smelly thats why we have to marry each other  regardless of our swing dancing ability for our next outfit
we swung into the  for a miniskirted fashion
forward wedding look there are so many things
happening right now number one on my mind is my giant hair followed closely by my giant earrings and then giant faux fur coat  fashion including but not limited to bridal fashion was all over the place with many different
styles entering the mix as well as a lot of people looking to express themselves
through their clothing similar to the  one of
the flagship fashion things about the  is the hemline and that is that it went up the miniskirt was a
trademark of the mod style which when it first started off stood for fans of modernist jazz but eventually became synonymous with modern fashionable young people of which style icon
twiggy was the queen bee   the twiggs   the the return of to thiccy thiccy two electric boogaloo and the mini as like the
silhouette of the future became so widespread that many brides in the  opted for
a short wedding dress to make a pretty bold fashion statement this look in particular is inspired specifically by
raquel welchs wedding look in which she wore a lacy
or crocheted mini dress and a big faux fur jacket but besides the miniskirt there were also a lot of other things going on with  bridal fashion now i think something
about  wedding dresses was that pretty much anything went like colorful wedding dresses space race inspired
looks very floral dresses amongst many many others including what i can only describe as a crocheted condom and yes that was supposed
to be a wedding dress you look like a little
like this basically with your little head stickin out now besides the mini
length of my lacy dress this look also included some blocky heels sizable geometric dangly earrings a small bouquet of daisies and a large cream colored fuzzy jacket i think the faux fur jacket besides being appropriate for a late fall wedding  is also very ish
because there was a sort of obsession
 affinity  affinity for furs because
of a few different movies including dr zhivago
 yeah  zhivago
 one of the two  trivago which was a super popular movie set in early h century russia so there were a lot of furs being worn jacket zhivago hotel trivago  is that right now for my face we tried to recreate a version of priscilla
presleys wedding makeup look which features an
intricate double eyeliner cut crease situation as well
as some big old fake flashes ooh thats cool  you have dolly eyes  to top off our makeup look we also added a light pink lipstick as lighter colors and even white lipstick were superin during the time  frosted was very popular also  frosted lips frosted
tips just kidding that was later that was  now as for the other fuzzy
part of the look my hair we went with a long sort of bouffanted in the back situation oooh  ooh ooh ooh  priscilla is that you  which as you can tell ended up very very teased and tall oh sorry
  are back yall   by priscilla presley
did you mean tracy turnblad  and besides having
actual roots in reality my hair was also giving off
some austin powers vibes   kinda like fembot hairstyle  we did fail to equip my boobs with actual rocket launchers   i love it  though thats probably for the best i like this look a lot i dont necessarily feel like im wearing a wedding look but i do feel very
 exceedingly  in general i felt sort of
like a jet setting bride with my i want to wear a miniskirt but the pan am jet is coldlook but tyler thought i looked
more like a sea faring bride   you look like you could be on gilligans island  whats her name ginger   you could be ginger  but thats more tropical this is more russia   so you can go
to gilligans tundra  gilligans tundra that is the sitcom that i star in coming to youtube premium next fall maybe so for our final bridal outfit we went with this very subtle  look just kidding its obviously crazy i am so covered in beads and pearls i dont know what to do im just its just its all over me what to react to truly
 its a lot  the  are a very
big decade for fashion sorry i meant a decade
for very big fashion as everything got larger and brighter from hair to blazers to eyeshadow to dresses to well
everything just everything and bridal fashion was no exception as gowns got poofier
rufflier and blingier if i was wearing this on our wedding day would you still marry me   hard yes  oh im sorry no hard i do   now this look includes a colorful pink and yellow bouquet a
giant headpiece situation that well talk about in a second and a high necked long
sleeved beaded mermaid style satin finished dress its kind of hilarious to me that all the other dresses have like aged naturally over the years and this dress is still white its a lot younger than the  dress but im not sure it will ever beige  olivia what do you think
this dress is made out of  oooh pastiche of polyester  oh pastiche of polyester there we go   its like a twinkie  its gonna be here with the cockroaches  this dress will outlive us all   definitely  now our look was inspired
by this wedding shoot that cindy crawford did that blessed us with many an epic 
bridal fashion moment but i think that most
 matrimonial style was inspired by princess diana her  royal wedding garnered
 million live viewers and people around the world adored her ruffly wedding gown and record breaking train even if they did take
the look and run with it to more rhinestoned places something thats kind of
funny about this dress is that the sleeves are
slight leg of mutton sleeves so there is kind of like
a return to traditional or victorian looks
incorporated into this dress but fied interestingly enough diana
had notably been inspired by the bridal looks of
royal family members past for her gown so its all
kind of coming full circle its the circle of sheep butt as for my head we ended up using my hair as a latch for the veil situation and put it up in a top
bun no sock involved all natural bun action  all natural bun action  and for the makeup we decided to go with soft washes of color like a violet for the eyes smoked out eyeliner blended out contour yes chisel the doublechin yes and sweeping pink blush
all over the cheeks which brings us to
whats on top of my head which is this thing
its the bret michaels of veils for sure cici constructed our
headpiece in two parts the tulle part in the back its literally   on top of the bun  a giant like christmas bow  on top of my head and the lace headband with flowers and cascading beads in the front  oh my lanta this is amazing yeah these are all made from stuff from michaels so you know get your craft on  every item from michaels
hot glued together   this is a frankenmichaels   besides the head piece the other element of the outfit that really puts over the top is the detachable train   is the train heavy saf could you make it down an aisle safiya  oh no its actually not that heavy it is a little bit like playing a game of snake with myself like i dont want to step on my own train   no thatd be bad  but besides that i feel good about it which ostensibly comes
off for partying purposes overall though its hard
to say with a modern eye i do think this dress is pretty awesome what ill say is im
definitely enjoying myself wearing this but if it looks good or not is a question that could be asked   i like the pseudo bride ninja because the headband it
looks like you could do a flying crane kick
and knock somebody out  i see where youre going with that but it is probably the
least stealthy outfit anyone could ever wear im like a cat with a bell on its neck you could find me because
if its not the rustling of the polyester that gives it away it might be the brief electric guitar solo that plays every time
this dress enters a room   all right waddle this way thats the wedding
version of walk this way   so those were our wedding
dresses through history i had a real blast putting
these looks together with the help of our
wonderful costume designer and makeup artist and i
thought it was supercool tracking how bridal style has evolved over nearly  years in particular i think its interesting how things fluctuate and get recycled like hems go up and down
and sleeves get puffed and then deflated and then reinflated because as social decorum
and tastes change fashion kind of does a circle its also interesting how certain things like veils and bouquets
are always included in bridal looks but change
in small ways over time overall its hard for me to pick just one favorite look from the bunch though i will say im
partial to the silhouette of the  dress and to
the veil of the  look none of them will really
reflect the style of the dress that ive chosen for my wedding but they do make me feel confident that in a  wedding fire drill as in if my dress just implodes i can throw one of these on and have a last minute themed wedding i mean hopefully that doesnt happen but tyler did say he
likes the karate kid veil thank you guys so much for
watching and once again a huge thank you to olivia

 yea just a little 
  im getting paid for this right 
  i promote your wedding you promote my nail polish  so previously on our channel we have gotten a lot of custom stuff like mixing up custom lipstick colors at the bite lip lab two of which are part of our color pop collab   real organic and weve also gotten custom shampoo foundation mascara and clothing from this weird suit so when i saw that orly had opened up a custom nail polish mixing bar in la i thought that since cristine was going to be dragging her frozen butt out of ottawa for vidcon we had to go together i mean we both have some experience mixing up our own cosmetic concoctions   ben come have a sip i made you something special ben
   no im good thanks  and cristine used to make videos about nail art    this is a nail art channel in case you forgot what the hell else would you subscribe for so it seemed like a perfect activity for the two of us mixing  nail polish  adult supervision  be safe with blowtorches kids alright so with that to the orly color lab we go or i guess we went so i made us an appointment at the orly mixing bar in west hollywood in the early afternoon on a weekday just so we hopefully wouldnt disturb too many other patrons and um were just standing behind this desk because i think the lighting is better at this angle  welcome  yeah were welcoming people into the store now its our new job we work here now we live here now because we do have a tendency to disturb the peace wait am i allowed to be here now for context cristine does have her own nail polish line holo taco which is what were talking about i guess im gonna be plugging a lot of things in this video cristines nail polish our frankenlipstick collab and orly is also a company that exists this is not sponsored but they did let us film there 
  i dont work here theres no affiliation   this is not a conflict of interest is this 
  you tell me man i think youre in charge here   oh god 
  so anyway the way they make your custom nail polish at orly is that they have bottles filled with different colors of polish that they squirt into a cup and stir together to whip up your shade  from there you can make adjustments to the color as well as add any extra fixings like shimmer or pearl  i was thinking maybe we should do one for each of us and then we should do a third color in which we just mix all of the possible colors they have   together to see what happens 
  you cant help yourself can you so with that plan in mind it was time for us to get our sht together and start a mixin  im eating my hair right now i feel like a mess today cristine will you help me make this video  i dont know if ill be able to help with that  all right lets see what happens lets see if the professionals can help us here  yeah just mix it up cristine i see you in my peripheral just get that cauldron going 
  safiya dont make me dance alone   is it this 
see i told you we were disturbing   we cant use that 
  no were using that 
  well be banished from the internet 
   how are you guys not banished from the internet   i dont know s so to start the custom color choosing elina from the color lab introduced us to their ipad interface which was sort of like an interpretive mood board with artful inspo pictures to draw you in 
  the way works you click on any color that you like this gives us an idea what direction of the color you want to go but its not the exact color that youre gonna get because were gonna make some custom at the mixology bar   so this is more of like an emotional process 
  yes 
  what do you feel 
  exactly  its like a meyers briggs and then once you picked a jumpingoff point there were a few other questions you had to answer before you could go up to the bar   cristine you want to go first you want me to go first 
  you go first   im gonna watch 
  okay so im gonna click night   of course 
  on brand as for what color i was actually hoping for i hadnt really gone into this with too many preconceived notions so i was just gonna let the photos speak to me  i am intrigued by this kind of teal color   i guess theyre calling it scaffolding teal 
  yeah scaffolding 
  and to be honest they were saying a lot of different things this is kind of an interesting sort of industrial moody exposed lightbulb the other one i like is jellyfish a lot of these things dont exactly jump to mind when i think of a cosmetics product   imagine if this spoke to you its just a brick wall 
  well that also speaks to me 
  thats what i speak to 
  yeah 
  most of the time but i did appreciate the creativity 
 i think the scaffolding is really speaking to me im gonna go for scaffolding im scaling a building with this teal after that you can pick if you want your shade to be lighter or darker and also choose your shimmers but elina had recommended that we not add those in now but wait until we had mixed up our color to decide what would look best with it
 oh crap i have to name it yes they do make you name your shade before you see it  that is a lot of pressure which actually presented quite the challenge  teal scaf   scaffolding saf 
  scaff teal scaf saf  scaf saf what does that sound like scab   scabby teal but we eventually hit some i wouldnt say gold 
  teal time  teal time but maybe some bronze 
  here for the teal   here for the teal 
 i like that thats like a drama channel 
  here for the teal is actually quite good all right im going for with here for the teal so with my form done it was time for cristine to step up to the plate   so ideally i did want to try and make a holo but apparently the orly color lab doesnt currently offer holo because their custom formula isnt thick enough to support the glitter   so im gonna change my idea and im gonna go a little simpler 
  mmm 
  and im gonna make something for my boyfriend 
  awww  so sweet but not really cuz i dont think he really wants me to paint his nails all the time but you know its the thought that counts   no i like that 
  i saw this banana and i immediately thought of ben guess bens brand is kind of built around bananas  because he likes bananas  it was the angle of the banana that reminded her of ben  no actually no everyone thinks that but youre all  just theres something wrong with your mind okay so cristine went with the banana because ben likes bananas and for no other reason   all right what are you gonna call it chiquita banana 
  no just benana 
  just benana okay 
  because his name is ben  i think everyone understood that  because his name is ben so after filling out our forms 
  first name simply   last name greatest 
 and not reading any of the fine print 
  make sure youre not signing away the rights to us  like giving orly permission to make this nail polish for you  please contact my lawyer it was time for us to head to the bar where we met emma our mixologist for the afternoon   all right so where should we begin 
  well i have whats essentially a recipe for your polish on here   so we start out with that and then i show you a swatch of it and we go from there 
  so its like starbucks   i would like two pumps of this syrup 
  and my recipe called for a heavy dose of green a bit of blue a dash of yellow and a smidgen of white and then she whisked all of the polish together with a mini mixer to make our first iteration of here for the teal   i mean thats a really pretty color i could maybe use a little more blue 
  yeah 
  yeah i think my instinct was that i wanted more of a nighttime scaffolding vibe 
 emma do you want it to be like a deeper teal in that case  i would just add also a little bit of black 
  you probably want that 
  you could add a little black  which seemed to add the right amount of duskiness to the mixture  i think that looks good 
yeah i like that a lot 
 then it was time to add the shimmers   so i probably recommend one of these three things 
  and emma thought that perhaps a gold shimmer a blueish iridescent pearly one or a blue metallic shimmer would work well with our polish   i think that i want the blue pearl and the blue metallic 
  okay   yeah i think thats what i want 
  that i love that for you   party 
  so emma scooped and dumped our powders in   i want to rub that all over me 
  all over your body 
 and then once they were satisfyingly blended into our concoction emma swatched the polish on my nail so i could see the shimmers in action   oh yeah thats what im talking about i like that we went for the middle finger here 
  yeah   thats not bad 
  i was pretty pleased with the way it was looking on my nail so we will bottle yeah lets bottle it   so i guess that was my polish 
  look you get your own custom label 
  oh does it stay here for the teal 
  sure does  thats for you 
 safiya amazing thank you and i think we were all here for the teal 
 i need to like smack the camera heres the teal   well it is on your middle finger so it kind of works 
  aside from the now very worn out tea jokes i also really did like the shimmery turquoisey shade we had ended up with 
  i think its beautiful   good job i approve 
  cristine approves everyone 
  not legally but just really good illicitly cristine approves  thats nice it suits you and with that we moved on to bens benana 
  wait is this it this is it were just taking the whole gonna just walk out of here cristine okay cristines recipe started out unsurprisingly with a lot of yellow 
  oh yeah banana yeah along with some white and a pinch of orange   its like creamsicle 
  oh thats good 
  and after blending it up like a jamba juice smoothie shes swatched it for further inspection i love the color but i think we need to make it more yellow and maybe if we add a little bit of like brown or maybe peach just to dull the color a little so its less neon yeah yeah i think cristine wanted more of a realistic banana color versus like a runts banana
  are we talking about a ripe banana or just like a
   well like a tiny bit rotten wanted it to emma if you wanted it to be like really a neutral yellow color i could do like a drop of black   shocking im curious though how that works 
  so we went ahead and added in a splash of black and then swirled it in 
 oh 
 oh  safiya something happened 
  see now it kind of looks dirtier this perfect thats what i want thats it yeah thats fair   so what are you thinking about in terms of shimmers 
  what are you thinking 
 im not gonna put the montages in dont make me do it at this point is just a white screen so for cristines polish emma recommended that she go for either a gold shimmer or a bronzy one   what if we do gold and a bit of the bronze shimmer 
  we can do that 
  lets do it   a sprinkle 
  just the whole thing actually cant you just put the whole thing in there   ooh it was almost like changed it a little bit 
  its deepening it i like it its aging the banana   its now three days older 
  so we had arrived at not only dirty but also aged banana oh   hows does that feel 
  thats really nice 
  yeah ben youll look great   ben looks great 
  so ben in all of his filthy glory got bottled labeled and delivered to his girlfriend   oh it looks so cute 
  they actually work together 
  they do work together 
  they accent each other nicely but before we could try them out we did have our third polish to make a franken polish that consisted of all of the shades they had in their little syrup bottles and we have gotten the okay to  pump it ourselves which were very jazzed about 
  why they trust me i dont know 
  dont ruin this for us so we were illadvisedly allowed behind the mixing bar im gonna get murdered by a tiny like a stick mixer its fine and because we didnt want our cup to runneth over we decided to go for a half pump of each of their shades   ahh 
  is that a half 
  eh it looked about a half 
  what did you scream cristine squawked and so our mixathon began oh this is fun  oh that one was explosive as we worked our way through the rainbow 
  oh we missed gotta hold it in there   there ya go 
  okay got a dribbler 
  yeah we got a dribbler there yes yes   my power is growing i guess you could call us madames mixalot 
  one more  oh yeah see thats marble time so we grabbed our stick blender and went to town oh yeah   that was good and its the frankenphora 
  it kinda looks like your lipstick 
  oh my god it does it looks like the franken lipstick color oh my god oh it smells good i mean dont breathe it in dont breathe in it i guess its not surprising that it turned out to be this berry purple which keeps showing up but hey i just like mixing stuff 
  mauve is that how you say it here mauve mouve   do you say it different in canada 
  mouve 
  mouve i think mouve is acceptable 
  yeah so once we had blended our polishes it was time to mix in every powder they had also alright so weve been left to our own devices so should we put the shimmer in 
now in total orly has nine different shimmer powders a blue metallic 
ooh  that looked like a firework 
 as well as a pink red gold  lets go for the gold white pearl silver bronze blue pearl and purple pearl 
  ready aim fire was like a deep mixing sound rrraahh  like a cat in heat our formula was definitely shaping up to be on the thicker side 
  sounds like im at the dentist but it was looking pretty nice that looks really pretty actually it kind of like lightened the color a little bit   it gives it like a kind of a silvery shimmer 
  yeah shall we fill a bottle  so we folded our cup to make a lip 
 why does this make me nervous 
 and began pouring in our franken polish  oh well youre making it in  which id say i did a passable job at 
 alright im in i got a little messy around the rim but im in i feel like a baby  please help me 
 so then we popped on our cap 
 how did i end up down here what am i still doing down here 
 and our franken orly came to life   look at what we made together 
  its a monster 
  my thighs are working   this is a thigh workout right now 
  my knees hurt 
  listen we are three day old bananas we cant be like this oh wow yeah  unfortunately though we were completely stuck when it came to a name for our shade 
  mauve 
  mauve over   you mauve me 
  maybe orly is on to something by making you name your  shade first 
  lets see a mauvie  lets see a mauvie   mauver like mother 
 because our ideas werent getting any better 
  were gonna think on this 
  i dont mauve 
  you dont mauve like you dont know 
  yeah it doesnt really work all right so were gonna think on the name for this oh actually maybe thats a good job for the audience   hey 
  really natural really natural transition there so if you have any ideas for what you would name this  mauvish color   let us know help us 
  comment down below 
  cause we had a good time mixing it but now were at a loss so with our work behind the bar complete we took our three newly minted polishes to one of their tables  so cristine could put them on me and we could see what they looked like in action 
  im gonna paint your nails finally   im painting your nails 
  but youre gonna do more of that later 
  or before depending on which video went up first  yes it was christines video hers came out like three months ago 
  but in real life i have never painted your nails yet   no 
  what is wrong with us theres something wrong with our relationship  there definitely  there are many things wrong with our relationship just schmash it again yep  schmash dat  
 motherfcking like button   okay so were gonna use the peel off base coat 
  this is cristines secret peel off base coat   no but actually 
  oh wow it is literally called secret peel off base coat wow i called that this product was actually very recently released but at the time of filming it was a prototype im the guinea pig here or more like the human because you know cruelty free  yeah we dont test on animals we test on safiya so once the base coat was dry it was time to apply our polishes benana first oooh ahhh followed by here for the teal and then untitled mauve its like the untitled goose game but nail polish oh i love that one i mean i like both of ours but i think i actually like our franken one the best and even with just one coat i can see the shimmer 
  because  there was a lot of shimmer relative to   there was a lot of it and cristine gave me a couple coats of each to get them nice and opaque   all right now all we need is a glossy taco 
  i wonder who has one of those well not officially but theres a secret one  this product is also already out 
  its a secret glossy taco 
  its not a secret anymore it really isnt a secret anymore but regardless it was applied to my nails   ooh yes she gone dry quickly 
  and with that my tricolor custom manicure was complete   i like the spirit of this actually 
  yeah 
  in a strange way these three colors kind of worked they did sort of come together into a muted summery beach umbrella kind of way does that make any sense kind of like a sparkly beach umbrella surprisingly the one that seems these sparkliest to me is the middle finger closely followed by our  franken polish and ben though i know there is sparkle in him is more of a cream 
  hes a hidden gem 
  yeah hes a diamond in the rough personally no offense to ben or to tea channels i think that the star of the show was our franken polish  both because it seemed like a pretty universally flattering shade and also because the amount of different shimmer thats in there makes it kind of multidimensional feeling but i do enjoy the unique andy warhol vibes of the benana color as well as the cool sea green scaffolding shade which im actually very excited to wear i think they look great actually im pleased how do you feel  i think they look good  i think i also did a good job painting them 
  cristine  
  just wanted to point that out 
  cristine did a great job painting them that was not the point of the video but cristine did a good job painting them   but you have to demo the product 
  overall i had a lot of fun at the color lab besides the chance to wreak small amount of havoc sorry   this is your store we should be letting you do this 
  im just gonna go to the back  im just finding your washroom i think its a great opportunity for people to perfect their favorite nail polish shade or maybe even make a custom color to match your favorite lipstick or phone case or cat for example hes like a shark and though we sort of teased it the ipad situation was actually kind of useful because even though the images are more philosophical it does get the creative juices flowing and help you think of colors you might not have even considered like i never thought i would want scaffolding on my fingers but here we are and im not sure that ben ever thought that his predilection for bananas would be immortalized as a nail polish but here he is thank you guys so much for watching and once again a thank you to cristine for coming with us to make some custom nail polishes thank you for inviting me also a big thank you to the orly color lab for letting us film there and not kicking us out which they definitely could have done if you liked that video make sure to schmash that like button and if you want to see more videos like this make sure to

  shout out to hahaha thanks for watching hahaha 
 and well see you guys anext time
  yeah exactly yeah thats perfect thats actually   youve nailed it youve absolutely nailed it youve nailed it hello friends and welcome to another video this week we are going to be making a giant lipstick probably the worlds largest but this is unsanctioned by guinness now we have done a lot of bad makeup science experiments involving lipstick in the past from mixing up custom colors to melting my own nude lipsticks together to fusing  plus lipsticks from different stores together to see what the midpoint shades would be and all of these experiments were born from some strange deranged lipstickobsessed recess of my mind from which another idea emerged what would happen if we tried to make a giant monstrosity of a lipstick i wondered a queen bee of lip colors a mind flare of pigments we had already made a small army of frankenlipsticks but that army was missing a leader but though our desire to create a giant lipstick was strong and burning once we sat down and tried to actually figure it out the logistics of the experiment seemed probably impossible at least without serious professional help however by happy coincidence just as all hope was lost colourpop reached out to us about the possibility of doing a lipstick collaboration and when the topic of what should we do for marketing came up we said how about a giant lipstick tube and surprisingly and probably illadvisedly they said yes now since our entire marketing budget went to making a giant lipstick lets talk about the collab really quick ive always wanted to produce like actual not kitchenmade versions of our frankenlipsticks and other colors weve mixed along the way so when colourpop reached out to us  i knew right away that i wanted to do a frankenbeauty collab our collection has six lipstick shades inspired by colors youve seen before in our videos before the greigey brown mrs norris the deep burgundy screamer the sharky teal brucy our og frankennude bikini bottom fred the frankenred  and of course the infamous mega frankenshade berry me in lipsticks you guys should check em out theres little bats on them its pretty cute and spoopy 
do people still say that okay so with that on to the giant lipstick now coming into this my wish list for an enormous lipstick was twofold firstly i wanted it to be at least my size when fully erect– –thats approximately 5 feet 9 inches so i could just walk right up to it and rub my face on it– –and secondly i wanted it to be able to twist up and down in some fashion currently there are a few other contenders for the worlds largest lipstick but they dont meet this spec there is a giant lipstick shaped sculpture made out of lipstick tubes but its more like a photo mosaic than a functional lipstick theres also an art piece that is like a cubic meter of lipstick on a concrete slab and though masswise it is a very heavy chonk of lipstick it neither looks like a lipstick tube nor does it do any of the things that a lipstick tube does i mean its basically a candle so it seems that a giant lipstick of the variety that i want does not exist weve identified a niche in the market so to realize our vision colourpop assembled a team of seasoned pros to help us pull this thing off alright so we are at the colourpop office today with dave the engineer here at colourpop the head–head of engineering director of engineering
   director of engineering there we go  and with keith and sydney who are production designers who are going to be helping us with this project so you guys know what we want to do  yeah
 youve heard it and youre still here so thats good  yeah dave as the engineer was gonna be in charge of molding and placing the actual piece of lipstick –or the crayon –into our giant tube and keith and sydney had been tasked with building the pieces of our lipstick tube or component so  thats  inches the lipstick that we sell now is 3 inches tall so weve got a little bit of scaling to do   a little bit our general plan was to take the proportions of a normal colourpop lipstick specifically one of our collab shades berry me in lipsticks and then scale it up like  to  times so the tube would be about five feet tall with the cap on but then when fully extended with the lipstick out the whole structure would be like six foot four   thats definitely taller than me
  now thats considerably taller than you   you might have to get onto like a little stepladder to actually use it on your lips saf  are you gonna use it   of course  i think we all have to of course having a lipstick that large presents many issues one of the main ones being the weight of all of the pieces  were looking at about an  pound chunk of lipstick  we dont know so daves plan was to make our giant crayon with a metal core inside of it which would hopefully help support the large amount of lipstick speed up the cooling time and also allow us to bolt it directly into the contraption that keith and sydney would be building besides the core pin colourpop was also gonna have to make us a giant custom mold specifically for our crayon its gonna be and daves ideal scenario was that we would shape and chill our bullet inside the mold and then place the entire thing on top of our base then well pull the two halves apart leaving the crayon standing and well
saf oh voilà  we will well have to do that um it all sounded like pretty standard makeup science until the word crane i was like uhcan i drive it no  yes but we did say we wanted to up the ante as for the casing of the lipstick keith and sydney had some thoughts it seemed like they were confident about how to make the tube itself which they were going to build with 3 giant cardboard cylinders that could stack inside of each other im like very impressed by the girth of this thing to represent the base the inner tube and the cap effectively this is what itll look like closed and then imagine you know the lipstick will end up being well  inches higher than this inside piece so   oh my god
 and we were gonna cover all three pieces  ooo 
 a calamity clam with flexible sheets of aluminum im like very jazzed 
  cool im jazzed is the word the word is jazzed but the part that keith and sydney were nervous about was the mechanism now with a normal lipstick tube there is an inner cup that contains the actual lipstick and when you twist the outside of the tube that inner cup rises up and down on a set of spiraling tracks and that works great for a three inch tall lipstick but not necessarily for our monstrosity first off because of the weight of the crayon the inner cup might just spiral back down and not be able to stay erect and handinhand with that twisting the outside of the tube would be very difficult because of how heavy and large the components would be besides all that we would have to order custom giant metal tracks and if they didnt fit a hundred percent perfectly the mechanism wouldnt even work but keith and sydney had a plan   so instead of like creating that whole scenario what we decided to do was saf oh so it just goes straight up   well its gonna be yes no saf just   yeah yeah so we added saf so its gonna be like a giant robotic lipstick basically 
  yeah
 yeah  basically
basically –and to hide the lift and the turntable keith and sydney were gonna be building a stage for the lipstick to stand on and all of the machinery would be hiding under there saf ooh oh my god thats me saf yeah so basically we had a lot of elements at play and many things to get before our building day but i had faith in our squad all right go team  lets roll out
 keiths sunglasses are everything   im gonna have my guys work on it i dunno if theres time but uhh well figure it out yknow   cut cut cut and a few weeks and a couple meetings later thats the–the pedestal it was time to build the damn thing saf alright so here we are back at colourpop ready to build colourpop has a pretty big campus with a fair amount of–for lack of a better word– –random warehouses so just so we would not disturb any actual makeup production saf woo and also so we could have the run of the place to ourselves we set up camp in this mostly empty one dave is going to be leading the lipstick crayon team basically and he is gonna start off by cleaning and lubing the mold thats– his words not mine laughter and then keith and sydney are gonna start loading in the pieces of the tube the pieces of the platform the pieces of the scissor  lift and were gonna start constructing that as well  awesome alright shall we 
 ready
  lets do it all right im just gonna insert myself into every situation here in general tasks were gonna be happening simultaneously throughout the day but our first priority was to get our lipstick bullets started because it was gonna need a fair amount of time to solidify and as we mentioned prepping the mold was task number one saf how do we lube  well first were gonna clean and then were gonna use some uh food grade silicone saf food grade silicone to lube ow that hurts  you look so devious with the latex gloves and like the lab coat  saf so team crayon leapt into action  shoot away tony 
 and sprayed down our mold with alcohol saf mmm– the funny thing is i didnt like recognize it as a lipstick mold until i just looked at it right now i was like oh yeah i see it  we have one of these at home  we have one of these   alright that constitutes the cleaning part now comes the lubing part  now comes the lubing part which we did so that the lipstick didnt stick to the insides of the metal casing and once it was greased it was time to put the pieces of the mold together  do you need me  a resounding no surprisingly the team of professionals did not want me to handle heavy objects but they did hand me a drill so i could help fasten the mold together alright ty you want to see me screw this thing  wooh alright thats it now i think this is as good a time as any to provide a brief safety disclaimer obviously im not being perfectly safe in this experiment so in general do not use me as a template as to how to use tools or what you should wear around tools im coming for you are you ready for me overall this is more of a mad science fair project than actual makeup production and it does not reflect how colourpop usually manufactures their products in any way awesome  alright someone take this away from me before i do something bad but nonetheless we did successfully piece together the mold oh ty look that looks like a lipstick you can see the slant for the uhh lip application and once we had our casing assembled it was time to lower in our metal core pin which we were gonna pour the lipstick around yeah this is looking pretty militarygrade guys
 and we wrenched it into place  its like extreme ikea
   just so it wouldnt rattle around in there 
so we have the mold constructed basically we have the core part in also now were gonna heat it up and then were gonna pour the lipstick in im pretty sure do i sound sure im pretty sure then against all reason and judgement i was handed one of my favorite things in the world 
 hold on  a blowtorch i guess its just a rule of the universe where there is bad makeup science there must be blowtorch saf oh all right so basically dave and i were gonna use our blow torches to heat up the mold from opposite sides  with the idea that if the mold is hot when the lipstick is added youll end up with a more uniform surface on the crayon because the lipstick wont solidify immediately as it goes in and our goal was to get it to  degrees fahrenheit for optimal lipstick pouring conditions unfortunately though i feel like we were torching it pretty hard the mold was not getting or staying hot enough am i doing it bad its just too big to keep hot is that the problem 
 part of it yeah
 oh no ideally dave had wanted to heat the mold from the bottom as well but we were all afraid that the mold would literally crush any hot plate we tried to put it on but it was seeming like we had no other option oh my sideburns are out they get they get excited by blow torches so we decided to delicately dangle the mold above the hot plate with the help of the forklift that dave had brought into the warehouse which amazingly worked and then finally after roasting it from every angle our mold started gettin real hot  dave was not talking about beauty guru gossip but our giant kettles of molten lipstick that we were almost ready to pour in so i continued torchin while team crayon brought over the cauldron and then it was time to pour d here it comes oh sorry    it smells amazing now ive poured a fair amount of lipstick in my day but nothing could have prepared me for this sounds like a pool drain doesnt it  it sounds like were filling up a pool is this helping am i doing this right our one vat only filled up our mold like threequarters of the way  oh wow we got a long way to go so we had to put away our first kettle and go get another one loud crash  its down
 dont worry nothing broke are you guys okay
 yeah
 alright were all good that was just the kettle snapping back into place she snapped saf it is so we poured in our second kettle and as the tide rose i started getting berry excited  okay were getting close were getting close slow down  slow down
 yeah i hear it oh wow and after topping it off just a hair our lipstick was in 
 alright 
thats so cool what a quantity of lipstick dave how do you feel how do you feel dave  uh gosh i think im pretty happy actually
 thats great so we trimmed off some of the excess with a spatula saf see this is um the real version of the rosanna pansino frosting spreader that i usually use and then cleaned up the outside of the mold before we let it cool alright i have successfully smeared lipstick all over it is that is that what we wanted me to do oh and lipstick on the forehead there  thats what i like  well im not seeing it but thats what i like to hear and to help it harden we were gonna be using a chilling table that might be it 
 there it is
there it is  speak of the devil the cooling table appears and our next big challenge was to get the giant metal mold on top of the cooling table put tylers face on it which required chaining it back onto the forklift and raising that sucker up high enough to stand upright we let it cool like this for a while and then used the forklift once again to help lower the mold onto its side  perfect perfect down alright  and even though it had been chilling for a little bit it was actually still pretty warm especially inside of the core pin  holy cow yeah feel that clearly it had a fair amount of cooling left to do so we left it for a bit to check in with team tube  people to help lift this thing over this great im so pleased that i showed up at this moment and they put me to work right away saf oo  yes youre definitely involved handing me a myriad of power tools this looks serious i was just handed a saw that was a choice and descending me inside of the platform to help adjust the lift im coming in 
 alright were well cut that part  specifically they needed me to pass some cords in and out so we could plug in the lift  and to make sure it worked i gave my body to science   no its not gonna go horribly
 and acted as the first human test subject of the lift it was one small step for me one giant leap for lipstick kind  um okay stop cool so i went back into my cave to finish off a few other tasks  goodbye 
 alright and once they had closed me in  they loaded the turntable onto the lift  down below its me down below as well as the pipe that the bottom of our crayon would lock into and then they lowered it all down to me in the dugout  saf oh so i could plug her in after that i begrudgingly left my den so we could prep the tube to put onto the platform thats all i need to do are we sure 
 yeah 
no more tasks in here in the dungeon all right ill get out because next up we had to add the frankenbranding on to the pieces of our tube so it matched the normal sized ones using these giant peeloff stickers of my name  and also of the large flock of bats that populate our lipstick cap and once we had straightened out our winged colony it was time to put all of the pieces together starting with plopping a podium on the stage look at that  we built it a podium that was going to hold the base of our lipstick tube in place which went on next i feel like im a high school boy polishing my car after that we screwed on a wooden mount to the bottom of our crayon which would hopefully puzzlepiece into the pipe that was currently sticking out of our base saf so now this goes in there too  then came the daunting task of lifting the entire mold situation   how heavy is the mold
 about  pounds  high enough so that it could be placed delicately onto the pipe  all right all right all right and this was the forklifts true moment to shine oh my god  whoa its gettin so high and then it was all hands on deck for team crayon to help ease the wooden mount into place  okay youre looking good its tilting in all right all right all right and once it was on we had to strip off the extremely heavy metal casing like a banana peel  all right now we want to unbolt our two halves guys all right here comes the last one oh there it goes okay and this is when our butts really started sweating  ohhhhh  
 okay youre free tommy the main concern at this point was that we didnt want the mold to swing back into the lipstick crayon and completely destroy all of our hard work so we had to very carefully take one half of the mold off of its chains and delicately bring it down but once it was off our giant crayon finally showed its face saf yoooo  and i gotta say it was a frickin ginormous lipstick it was quite the sight to behold almost like the velociraptor hatching scene in jurassic park it was magnificent from there we took the other half of the mold off with the forklift d there you go youre free and just like in jurassic park things quickly started to go awry  okay we are definitely leaning guys were definitely leaning mainly as we tried to lower the lipstick further into the tube    okay were going down
 the surface of our beautiful crayon started to crack  its kind of like a chocolate bunny  like a hollow chocolate bunny i think from a combination of the weight of the lipstick pressing against the core pin as well as the rapid temperature change from when the mold was removed so speed was the name of the game for the next couple of minutes everyone was pretty nervous that it was moments from full implosion
  i was like its over so to get to the finish line before utter disaster we gently placed the inner tube over the crayon
  oh god  sorry i just i looked up and there it was 
 oh shoot and then once it was all put together i gave tyler back the camera and hopped on stage so i could try to massage our lipstick back to life saf i feel like we can just shmooth it a little bit it starts looking a little nicer and i think some combination of the warmth of my hands and the semimolten lipstick i had been given to act as a mortar was kind of working saf kind of like the ramen hack for your kitchen but in this case its lipstick on a giant lipstick and although i couldnt fully fix all of the cracks it was looking enough better that we figured we should film it now or forever hold our peace you know in case it fell to pieces saf alright so this is definitely the largest lipstick ive ever seen i mean if it isnt the tallest lipstick in the world then ill eat my hat or this entire lipstick and since we had a few things we wanted to do with our lipstick we had to move quickly alright so i think we should apply this thing to my face right im a little nervous to mount it and like get in there but i did originally want to just kind of like put my mouth right on it you know what im saying my lips  no i didnt wanna french it okay im not an animal i was a bit nervous to step up onto the podium   but my dream was to put my face on its face so i had to be bold 
 have no fear
 oh my god have no fear the giant lipstick is here i know im like leaning in for the kiss what i will say about trying to apply giant lipstick is that its not really the right shape for anyones mouth except for maybe heidi klum from ella enchanted  but i felt like going for a corner of the tip would give me the best shot 
 wow
  honestly  honestly its on my teeth i can feel it but besides that im feeling pretty good about that oh and i i think i smoothed out a little crack there i think ive discovered a secret talent applying giant lipstick oh wow not a halfbad application to be honest try and fix the cupids bow a little bit its a little wonky but it looks pretty nice no there was no tongue action whatsoever okay it was just like a dementor after getting a few posing shots of me and the lipstick    it seemed like it wasnt really continuing to crack so we felt comfortable enough to try and twist it up using our machinery  let er rip with me holding its waist as it rose into the air in case anything fell off it looks like a ballerina
  its amazing  yeah and we were all amazed to see that even with some fractures our lipstick was stayin alive 
 shes cute  she is cute
 now once i felt more confident with touching and posing next to the tube our lipstick human buddy cop comedy started turning into more of a romcom or maybe even something raunchier im going like under under the lid right now you see this 
 youre getting a little inappropriate
yeah this is a little inappropriate  im really just fondling is the is the word to use  yeah so to get me away from the lipstick for a second it was time for everyone else to get a chance to put it on and try it out saf oh you know what that looks pretty precise from here its pretty creamy ive been massaging it for awhile so its nice and warmed up laughing like the color pop team our wonderful production designers and also our editors who were on set with us a little on the chin but otherwise lookin good  yes emily yes see the color looks good on anyone and everyone could be yours and i will say its not necessarily the most sanitary of makeup products so germaphobes look away but it is very fun like a vanity fair spread vanity fair but make it sweaty so after a while of messing around with our giant lipstick and it still being here we were feeling bolder than ever now when we had first put everything together we had sacrificed some of our original plan because of how nervous we were  oh sht but at this point we felt confident adding all of the bells and whistles like boosting the height of the base up a little bit which would hopefully enable us to get the crayon far enough inside it to put the cap on this is what we wanted to do originally so im very excited about it but there is a small chance that the cap is smushing the tip of the lipstick were all about to find out so we attempted to showcase the full functionality of our lipstick with the cap coming off   its fine alright here we go
  let er rip
  and then a twist up with the added height  and i gotta say it was beautiful  it was definitely more of a monet like better looking from far away there are a lot of finger prints on it and a lot of uh lip prints on it but sort of like the liberty bell the venus de milo and the giant sphinxs schnoz the cracks almost showed what a masterpiece it truly was and all of the trouble it had gone through to finally reach its highest height okay so uh  that is a lot of things to do with a giant lipstick overall im very pleased with how this lipstick turned out  from the batty design to the twisting up and down to the faceplant application and though there were some emotional highs and lows and about  minutes there where it seemed like the whole thing was just going to epically fail i did in the end get to fulfill my dream of taking an awkward prom photo with a sixfoottall lipstick i will say it was also kind of spectacular to see how a team of professionals would approach this project and take our bad makeup science to the next level besides that it was kind of a trip to see our franken lipstick color that we made in a gumbo pot in our kitchen more than a year ago presented in such a huge and magnificent way and once again not to be cheesy this shade and these five others could be yours to own if you click the link in the description below besides the berry me in lipstick shade which youve seen enormous quantities of today we have our whole family of frankenlipsticks mrs norris screamer brucie bikini bottom and fred the frankenred dont worry you wont be getting any of the stuff i groped but it will be this color a truly ginormous krakensized thank you to everyone who made this possible like the entire team at colourpop and our squad of production designers  i think so  yeah  and yes pour one out for dave who had to leave after normal business hours but was still an integral part in making this all come together also another thank you to colourpop for agreeing to this insane idea my personal philosophy is that makeup should be about experimenting and having fun and they were really down with that which was pretty cool as for what were going to do with the giant lipstick we are still figuring that out but right now colourpop just has a giant lipstick on their premises which im sure theyre jazzed about thank you guys so much for watching if you liked that

and i will see you guys anext time ♫ upbeat intro music ♫ hello friends and welcome to another video this week were gonna be having a mcdonalds wedding in hong kong this is not gonna be our real wedding but this is a real thing that mcdonalds actually does now as some of you probably know i am engaged betrothed affianced and tyler and i are in the process of planning like a nonfast food related wedding in america which is still on but a few months ago while doing research for that wedding i somehow fell into a treasure trove of articles and videos about a unique experience thats offered at some mcdonalds in hong kong which is that you can get married at them and not just like its possible to get married there its actually encouraged as in they offer wedding packages where theyll decorate the place perform a wedding ceremony and even provide an emcee  to host the whole event it sounds pretty epic and even though im not like a mcdonalds superfan though who doesnt enjoy allday breakfast im kind of dying to know what its actually like so i figured that during our trip to hong kong this year we had to swing by a micky ds and get “notmarried” there were gonna be trading in golden rings for golden arches im lovin it and my husband billions served and a couple dozen married no this video is not sponsored alright lets do it so hong kong was stop number three for us on the east asia trip after tokyo and seoul and while we were there we stayed in the tst neighbourhood  in kau lun which has a lot of shops and restaurants of all different international cuisines now thats what im talkin about crunch as well as super easy access to the hong kong harbor and the star ferry which we took a lot we have a ton of footage from the ferry in fact we have footage of people taking footage from the ferry everyones filming now before we get into it i do want to mention the current situation in hong kong really quick since our trip to hong kong in late may there has been a lot of protests and political tension and we really hope that everything can be resolved peacefully but that said we still wanted to show you guys all of the fun things we filmed in hong kong because it really is a cool place with a lot to offer and we really enjoyed our time there so with that on to our mcdonalds wedding which we had planned for the afternoon on our second day in hong kong in a o6 pm time slot  safiyas over here throwing on her makeup shes got white on  i know  which we had to go find and buy  yes we went shopping yesterday in hong kong and got a couple little outfits  i look basically like i am going to a country club  you do look a little bit like um andy bernard but not pastel  now besides outfit shopping planning a wedding is hard enough let alone planning a wedding  miles away but thankfully our friend taylor r a hong kongbased youtuber and her team member natalie were able to provide us some local assistance coordinating the big day  i think they think there might be like a ten percent chance this is like a jim and pam speed wedding  yeah like this is our actual wedding  i mean apparently in hong kong all you need is a lawyer present and then you can get married so when i was first planning it taylor was like do you want a lawyer and i was like i mean i guess we could
 now as for the venue none of the mcdonalds in the tst area are actually equipped to hold a wedding party so we had booked our wedding at the festival walk mall location about a fifteen minute drive away  because this is at a mall you could say lets go to the mall  i was just singing that  to get fake married  its not fake married  uh notmarried  its almost like an engagement party cause we never had one of those  no youre right  after speeding through the rest of my makeup my bridal look was complete  you look good i like this dress  i just burped thank you   and it was time for us to head over to micky ds  do you think we should try like mcdonalds themed vows  like you are definitely not a value meal i would definitely supersize my love for you  i dont think there is a vow part  so we hopped in a cab to get to our wedding as you guys can see it was raining and as always extremely humid outside and besides messing with our camera it also didnt help tylers hair situation which had pulled a monica from friends pretty much as soon we landed in hong kong  its the humidity and so i had tried to do something about it  my hair is weird right now   i made tyler smooth his hair down i think it looks good but he doesnt like it
   it looks weird so this is tylers general hair preface  its necessary okay it gets weird it gets weird  but anyway as we were ascending the escalator to mcdonalds i spotted some of our guests  thats taylor and natalie i think natalies brought a few friends  good we wont have an empty wedding  aah youre in white  i know isnt it weird  white  people were very excited to see you in white it is a little bit like a bigfoot sighting now the mcdonalds we were going to was on the top floor of like seven levels in the mall and sat above an indoor ice skating rink which i guess isnt that weird but i dont think i have ever seen one in a mall before and the mcdonalds itself once you get inside it is definitely pretty nice with like selfserve kiosks a hot drink counter and a pastry shelf its basically like if mcdonalds ate a starbucks and for our nuptials we headed back to their designated event room which had been decked out for us  theres a lot of people in here hi everyone   hi
  welcome to our wedding kind of   we had booked the happiness party package for  hong kong dollars or about  usd  oh my god ty this is epic and with that they basically offer a chinesestyle suite of wedding decorations or a westernstyle one which is what we chose and i tried to get as many of the trappings as i could it does seem like they used to offer a few other fun things that were no longer available which well touch on in a second but regardless i was pretty pleased with our spread   this is awesome
   besides the decorations we did have a few people there like our hong kong crew so here weve got taylor natalie zoey and sandy hello hello as well as tylers parents  wouldnt miss it for the world  you know were not getting married right now right who had been in taiwan the week before so they just kind of hopped over also our editors who had been traveling with us were there as well emily and claire not pictured they are also here as we got settled in the party emcees of the event thomas and winkle jumped right into the festivities  this is the gift from our hong kong mcdonalds for friends when you come to our mcdonalds to get the weddings  oh thank you  this is awesome does he get anything   is that a little boutonniere 
  yeah tyler i was just kidding so they gave us two corsages to go with our fun balloon bouquet  it kinda feels like a hot dog at the bottom and once we had been flowered our emcees explained that before the set mcceremony it was time for dinner   so its feeding time first
  yes  we feast hong kong mcdonalds does have a fair amount of familiar menu items  well its my wedding right so i can have a mcflurry for like the main course but they also have a lot of things that i have never seen on their us menu like some signature drinks cheese tea right as well as a crowd favorite amongst our guests  yeeeaaaah everybody loves shake shake fries apparently so we ordered a bunch to see what the fuss was all about  and then you pour the milkshake into the bag and they also give you a little flavor packet which you pour into the bag too and then start shakin taylor also likes to eat her shake shake fries with ice cream sort of wendys frosty style  is this okay with you taylor  its good good  i havent seen her swallow it yet  very quickly the rest of our food arrived and they try to present it kind of fancily  oh its beautiful but it was in the end though appetizing still just normal mcdonalds food  alright this is our feast  tyler got a big mac and his coveted mcflurry i got a grilled chicken sandwich also and a cheese tea and of course we had to try the muchhyped shake shake fries   does it look good
  oh it smells amazing yeah  so tyler started rattling them around like maracas which quickly turned into a rendition of the harlem shake shake fries  this is not sponsored by mcdonalds  its sponsored by shake weight   yeah   and they ended up being pretty tasty but the dancing did make tyler work up a bit of sweat  this is the ceremonial dab  yeah  this is love here oh stop stop stop  i dont think ive ever dabbed on camera before and i think i just did it like very badly  im just gonna be dabbing left and right but bedsides the shake shake fries  cheers  we did have our other food to eat and romantically feed each other i just got a good view of the chewedup big mac this is my life now  forever and to give our dinner more of a wedding feel tyler called for a toast  alright ready and his dad answered that call  would you like my halfdrunk cheese tea  no one wants my cheese tea  this is a great honor for your mother and me to be here  couldnt be more happy than to welcome safiya into our family   hopefully not at mcdonalds  hopefully at mcdonalds  no were just trying to be nice  but regardless i thought it was a pretty good impromptu speech   to tyler and safiya may you have many happy meal returns  ah thats not bad thats not bad so with everyone fed and toasted the party emcees were ready to move on to the ceremonial segment of the wedding  and they called us up to the altar if you will  thank you  we went shopping yesterday now i dont think mcdonalds provides these balloon wedding rings anymore but i wanted a pair so badly that natalie actually commissioned her friend to make us some  whoa this is awesome  they then directed us to exchange them which i think if there had been a lawyer there would have been the actual marriage part   oh yeah
  awwwww   yes thank you yes
  yeah right here  everything is squeaking and i was pretty impressed by our rubber bling damn look at that rock this thing must be what 5 6  thousand carats   you look like a pimp  this is that adsense money   after the exchanging of the rings they had some more fast foodoriented activities for us to do  essentially they wanted us to lady and the tramp an iconic mcdonalds french fry and kiss in the middle  actually based on their script maybe thats when we wouldve gotten married so next up was a sort of drinking ritual which apparently is a chinese wedding tradition centering around the idea that wine sounds like long time  except in this case instead of wine they had provided us with orange fanta to drink  dont spill  like this like this  they did kinda throw us into this one but we did our best  bringing us to the part of the ceremony that i was really excited about oh my god yes which was a jenga tower of apple pie boxes shaped like a wedding cake which they wanted us to place on top of the pyramid im still not sure why we did this exactly because its kind of the opposite of cutting a cake but they did then want us to feed each other while doing the arm cross thingy how do we like twice thomas mightve been trolling us with this one but unlike with the heart pose we were pretty successful at this wow i think we did that without spilling  that was really romantic now after our first apple pie tyler was feeling somewhat intimidated by the giant pile of them in front of him  we have a lot of apple pie right now  i dont think all of these are full which was both a bit of a let down and also a huge relief most of it is structural but there are a couple of strategic filled ones  yeah i was like we have six guests youve seen this but dont worry our guests still got something as thomas and winkle brought out a platter of chocolate pies i think because they didnt even have enough apple pie in the entire store natalie likes it natalieapproved after we all ate a fair amount of dessert the emcees announced that it was time for the game portion of the wedding maybe they usually have more kids in attendance at these weddings who are eager to play some balloon games but for our wedding we were gonna need every person there to participate the first game we were gonna be playing was called love bombs in which tyler and i were supposed to toss balloons at the pairs and they were supposed to receive them  or so we thought  sure yes thus began the most chaotic five minutes of any wedding ever minus the murdery ones from game of thrones of course in which we just hopelessly threw balloons at our gueses and they tried to hoop them with their arms it was at this point the party emcees desperately trying to wrangle the situation explained that we had not even been playing the game correctly apparently instead of hooping youre supposed to pin the balloons between your elbows so with renewed direction we ran it back for round two but even though we thought we understood the game better we didnt understand it at all apparently you were supposed to collect multiple balloons rather than just dumping them on the ground as you can see winkle here desperately trying to convey to us but i think at this point our guests were done with the rules and it just became the thunderdome  this went on for a few more seconds before the emcees decided to end the madness tylers parents were reasonably disqualified  for a variety of reasons  and i think everyone else was declared a winner just because now i think against all reason and judgment the mcs decided to go ahead and have us play a second game so basically this game was kind of like human ring toss and suddenly it was game time and i will say that it seemed like everyone was a bit better at playing love hoops than they were at love bombs though there was still some illegal grabbing of the rings occurring some assistance from the mcdonalds employees and just as much yelling and in the mayhem somehow this happened so all in all it was a pretty fun game mostly because i won i got one i got one i dont even know how so with the games over and our two hour slot almost done it was time to thank our guests for coming i had forgotten we had paid for these but our guest favors were personalized mcdonalds thank you cards with our faces on them and mcdonalds keepsake tumblers see we did buy them presents and regardless of how branded they were it was a nice surprise for our guests and also for us so they gave us a little time for some wedding photos  here  im just sticking his nose hair back in his nose with our guests our emcees and our wide variety of decorations just so we could document and remember this joyous occasion and then finally it was time for one last wedding tradition now im gonna throw my bouquet ready over which shoulder over which shoulder  i would say you go like straight over the head yeah  okay ill try alright ready and my bouquet sailed directly to natalie  so well all return in one year for natalies wedding right here right here im not sure that natalie actually wants a mcdonalds wedding but if she does im so there after that they gave us a few more minutes in the room to take some final photos and then it was time to head out  what do you think good wedding  yeah  great wedding so we packed up our gifts and headed back to our hotel i think it was for the best anyway we didnt really need any wedding day wipeouts alright so i think thats like mostly our mcdonalds wedding overall i had a great time we came we saw we ate we ballooned  we ballooned thats the big one yeah  both literally and metaphorically i really enjoyed how they inserted fast food themes into traditional wedding rituals which made it feel more like a unique experience and not just like a wedding that happened to be at a mcdonalds and i also have a giant ring that said where i would say there was some room for improvement was with the catering it would be nice to have something special like a ceremonial wedding burger or maybe like a nuptial dipping sauce for some unity tenders i dont know just something to think about now i personally still wouldnt choose this for my actual wedding but thats not to say i dont see the appeal mcdonalds has said that they started offering weddings through popular demand both because people were meeting each other at mcdonalds and therefore wanted to get married there and also because some couples just wanted a casual and cozy environment to tie the knot and sort of similarly to how we had a prewedding celebration it seems like couples will have mcdonalds wedding parties for other weddingrelated events like reception afterparties anniversaries and engagement parties as for us we are still planning a different wedding later this fall but as far as fake weddings go well its no jana wedding but it was pretty good thank you guys so much for watching and once again a huge thank you to all of our guests for coming from near and far to attend our mcdonalds wedding like tylers parents i think we all had fun  yeah
 definitely especially the balloon game and the hk squad taylor natalie zoey and sandy also i wanna thank taylor and natalie for helping us plan this mcdonalds wedding as i implied earlier ive been emailing natalie for months harassing her you guys did a great job thank you so much for all your help you just wanna grab it  i just wanna touch it  just like grope it a little bit its a good handful thats all you need is a good handful

to emily b for watching thanks for watching emily b and i will see you guys anext time intro music hello friends and welcome to another video today were gonna be shopping at a counterfeit designer night market in hong kong its gonna be kind of like shopping on wish but in person oh demon pants strange demonic cat hissing now for a long time ive been hearing about these fake markets in hong kong and other parts of east asia where vendors will set up like blocks and blocks of stalls and sell fake well a lot of things but notably fake designer clothing and accessories that sometimes look pretty identical to the original product but also sometimes not  is this real gucci  yeah and recently ive been seeing people on youtube doing full fake night market tours and hauls across asia haggling and buying stuff like fake chanel bags fake supreme camo hats and even fake yeezys for like  bucks and though im not a super avid consumer of real designer clothes unless theyre heinously ugly  i am pretty interested in visiting these markets and seeing just what kind of fake stuff is available there now of course counterfeit goods are sold in the us as well but i feel like the fake vendors here are more on the downlow and secretive and from what ive heard and seen in hong kong its way bigger and way more out in the open with markets like right smack dab in the middle of busy neighborhoods next to like normal stores that sell real versions of the fake things sold at the market so i figured that during our travels to east asia this year  egg tarts we could stop by one of these fake markets in hong kong purchase ourselves a fake designer haul and maybe even transform into a fake hypebeast all right lets go so hong kong was our third and final destination of our asia trip after tokyo and seoul and in hong kong we were staying in the tst neighborhood in kowloon which is like a shoppingnightlife area with a lot of malls a random charlie brownthemed cafe  woah laughing  his mouth just fell off and a really great view of the hong kong harbor  i want to get on a boat  me too and to help us get to the night market we were joined by our friend taylor r a hong kongbased youtuber who knows her way around a market or two as well as her team member natalie so we hopped on the train to get to the ladies market in the mong kok neighborhood a few subway stops away now as for my approach to the night market i was going in from more of an inquisitive angle trying to see what items and brands they even had knockoffs of i was definitely gonna try and do a little bit of haggling because everyone does and they kind of expect you to try and bargain at least a little bit but to be frank im not very good at it especially pushing past the part where the seller starts seeming angry  no i want that burberry one  aye nooooooooo  yeah i mean i think some of the draw of these fake markets is like how good of a deal can you get and also like how close to a real fake can you get but since none of it is real designer stuff anyway im just gonna focus on getting a cool haul also although you can film at the night market its pretty close quarters and a little hectic in there so dont be surprised if some of the footage is a little crazy  my gopro is strobing  so it looks like even more like found footage  its like blair witch project night market edition  laughing now before we get to shopping i just want to mention the current situation in hong kong really quick just because i feel like it would be remiss not to say anything since our trip to hong kong in late may theres been a lot of protests and political tension and we really hope that everything can be resolved peacefully but that said we didnt want to not show you guys all of the fun and interesting things we saw and filmed in hong kong because it really is a cool place with a lot to offer and we really enjoyed our time there so with that back to our quest all right so we are here at the ladies market in mong kok about to do some um counterfeit item shopping is what i would call it the mong kok neighborhood in general is a very fastpaced shopping area with stores and other businesses at street level and then tons of apartment buildings above it all it actually also holds the guinness world record for busiest district in the world and you do get a sense of that while youre here like in the streets and also when youre crammed into the market itself  its kind of like a stream of fish  youre just following the person in front of you and what doesnt help that though its not unique to mong kok is just how hot it is in the summer in hong kong  were definitely wet enough to be fish  yeah so please excuse the endless layer of shine in this video it was very humid and i wasnt prepared  is this a good shot  just like your sweatstained forehead  just context  just trying to shape out the whole story here sweat aside our approach to the shopping was basically that we were going to be trying to put together headtotoe fake outfits  so were gonna be probably looking for  underwear top bottom bag  and shoes and maybe like a hat  oh like a finishing accessory and the goal wasnt necessarily to get a cohesive outfit but just to get a fake designer item in each clothing category  its a joey tribbiani  youre just getting it onto your body  yes  i like as many names as possible in like logos  that is the objective  and you get minus one for supreme laughter now the ladies market itself is kind of like a giant tented alleyway spanning like five pretty overwhelming blocks  i just am hearing like   people bargaining at one time and its almost like its own little world in there  its like the worlds biggest pillow fort  pillowfortyeah  oh yeah cuz like  theyre just like tons of like tarps  yeah  whats really interesting about this is they take all of this down  so they set it up every day  wow  all of these tents  so the hustle here is real right away i noticed that there was also plenty of not fake stuff for sale at the market  yeaaaaah  the music too  i feel like im at a rave most of which fell into the souvenir or gag gift categories but pretty quickly we started finding some of the counterfeits we were looking for  there are those like um  sequined supreme bags and once we had drawn first blood they were everywhere particularly with bags and with so many options it was kind of hard to know what to pick like right off the bat so we decided to start with a different category that was a little less intimidating  oh maybe we should go sneakers first as we had stumbled upon a pretty promising looking shoe stall  oh my god these are um  balenciagas that look like socks  but by that i mean  baienglacas that look like socks this stall had a wide variety of brands to offer  im gonna become a counterfeit shoe sneaker head like louis vuitton gucci onitsuka  oh wow  good selection of yeezys too but with a few slight alterations  alanxedre moqeeun  moqueen i like alot  yeaaaah  mo queen i guess instead of true fakes i would consider these to be more in the knockoff or dupe territory where they kind of thread the needle of not actually pretending to be the original brand by just slightly misspelling the brand  they have baienglaca  and they have  billyoh higayaga yaga yaga  what on earth or just by putting some gibberish text on there  yeah theyd even try on that one  yeah i dont even know what that is  they just gave up so after surveying what they had in stock it was time to choose what we wanted to get i sort of already had my heart set on my pick  i want this one  those are awesome and in the distance there was a pair that caught taylors fancy  is that one chanel  yeah  i see a ch so im just saying yes  oh wow and they even had a little bonus on the heel  it says chanel and then on the side  i think it says adidas on the back  oh okay got it  two brands for one  i heard its twice as valuable 
 so taylor happily settled for these ones  thats amazing  im already winning in the how many logos you can get on  i didnt realise it was a competiton  laughs i just made it one and then it was time to haggle so our shoes in total were originally priced at  hong kong dollars   and then mine are  and we came in offering  hong kong dollars total    yeah   yeah   okay   for both  yeah yeah yeah  what about  the shopkeeper never actually formally accepted our offer of  he just kind of ushered us deeper into the store  sit down and try  he wants you to try it and i think that meant the deal was on im not sure we got a great price because although he was quiet he did seem quite pleased but it was our first haggling experience  ooh these are comfy taylors sample shoe that she had picked up fit her well so they gave her the other foot of the pair right away which surprisingly did not say chanel  oh i just take these ones  whoa those are pharrell  oh my god this just keeps getting better  it says pharrell chanel  oh it rhymes and between the pharrell and adidas we were all pretty sure at the time that the fake market had just like made up a design  is that a real shoe  nno  i mean thats a real shoe  im just sain i wonder if theres  a real pharell chanel  cause its like a good idea but apparently after looking it up this actually is a true fake of a real collab shoe that exists so although we assumed it was an egregious typo it was actually our lack of fashion acumen that led us astray now unlike taylors shoes my baienglacas were quite roomy  oh these ones are a little big do you have a  or  so the shopkeeper had to call in a smaller size  oh two minutes  i think that the size is coming from somewhere else taylor yeah im not sure what the backroom situation was but my smaller size eventually appeared  oh perfect  oh they still say baienglaca thank god so with the correct sizes in hand  this ones good  no arch support  but i dont know if the real ones have arch support  so i think im okay with that  theyre socks we purchased our shoes which came to about fifty four us dollars for fake versions of real shoes that cost almost two thousand dollars usd  great thank you  shoes acheck  my hair is just sticking to my face  and my skirt is just sticking to my butt  all right lets go 
 yeah so with one item down it was time to return to our search  alright so theres lots of bags  oh wow  oh oh wow though we did almost get sidetracked by animal nose thongs at a stall nearby  very exciting very exciting stuff as i mentioned earlier there were a fair amount of good handbag candidates  oh wow yeah rapada so it was sort of tough to figure out what to pick though there was a particular stall that caught taylors eye this stall also stocked some other pretty highend brands like fake birkin bags and fake dior  oh the i is missing just dor  oh thats what im talking about i want dor dar as well as fake gucci  oh yeahhhh  god damn it  sorry i was way too pleased with that joke  that was like not even a joke the shopkeeper overheard us admiring the fake gucci or i guess guddi bag and swooped in to let us know about his secret stash  in the back  yeah where he kept his nonmisspelled substantially more expensive fakes  what about for the gigi which he had a full catalog of on his ipad but partially because those were a little more out of our price range and also because we kind of liked the misspelled ones more we turned our attention back to what was already in front of us  this ones caught my eye i think in particular this crossbody dior saddlebag  i actually have this one  im kind of mad now because it looks the same laughs as taylor surveyed a few more options the shopkeeper was determined to show off the bags  oh we got a model  that looks great  i think you should buy that one and also to convince us that the bags were real leather by making us smell them though im not sure how well that tactic was working for him  doesnt smell like it it was a good thing that taylor was there to sniff him out though because i had no idea what i was supposed to be smelling  i think taylor has a better nose than i do  im like i dont know now given that we had never really expected to get real leather anyway we decided to go for it and get the original horseshoe guddi bag and the decently real looking fake dior saddlebag  how much for this one and with our purses chosen it was time for a haggling round two  okay  for these two how much i dont know if it was my loyalty to the dor brand or his modeling moves but i really didnt get us a good deal which i could tell because he accepted my offer very quickly  third times the charm  or fourth or fifth or sixth so we paid for our bags and to set off to find our next item  thank you laughs it was not taylors birthday so with the shoes and purses down we ventured ever deeper into the market searching for more items and finding many that were interesting but not useful to us like knockoff disney princess dolls  these girls right here theyre called fashion perfect  and theyre all like a little bit offbrand as well as fishshaped slippers  oh my god fish flops  i totally have a pair of these at home  oh do you  yeah look theyre for babies  baby fish flops  mommy fish flops amongst other funky looking trinkets  look at those speakers those are kind of awesome but we eventually found a fake designer tshirt store that seemed like it could have some clothing for our outfits  but they have a supreme ripndip like collab shirt  i also like kermit with a supreme shirt on  yeah selling brands like moshino comme des garçons offwhite and balenciaga  oh wow no but doesnt say ah baienglacas so in that case 
 trash yeah  if it doesnt say baienglacas i dont want it right off the bat a couple of things caught our eye  there is bape here too notably those bape hoodies that kind of make you look like a pea in a pod  i feel like they have like a very iconic zipper  which could be troublesome as well as some of their fendi stuff  i kind of like the fendi like monster shirt  yeah its pretty great  its also like a matching couples version  so if you want to indulge that we could wear that  i feel like thats its own video almost  counterfeit fake designer matching outfits they also had a pair of black and yellow offwhite sweatpants that i was drawn to  i kind of like these  those would look good with the fendi  oh yeah 
 it matches  oh that is great taylor that could be your thing that we thought could round out the look  okay im thats what i want  okay so then maybe ill go bape  yeah thats perfect  ive always wanted to try this full up zip so after trying on and picking out our sizes  yeah i dont know actually its pretty similar  i would go with the mediums it was time for haggling round three and this time i let taylor take the lead    bemused laughter  okay okay okay which left us with a slightly better result than our previous rounds  okay  all right great the shopkeeper didnt seem too angry with us but she also didnt wish taylor a happy birthday which i took is a good sign  i think taylor did a good job  yes 
 yeah after settling on a price we were left to cool down while she grabbed our sizes from yet another mysterious elsewhere  im just like a bug to the light  im just standing near the fan  oh theres a fan  yeah   if you buy something you can stand next to the fan  yeah exactly then youre in the good graces and besides the cool air there were a couple of other hidden gems back there  oh theres fake peppa pig  fake peppa pig gucci if only we had seen that earlier after that we collected our haul  okay perfect  thank you and went on our way with all but taylors bottoms accounted for so we bopped over to another clothing store nearby that was similarly hight beastie and decided to purchase a pair of blue fake bape shorts for taylors look  i think the shorts are  more matching and we have a doublefaced guy and then we forged ahead past some distracting kitchenware  oh wow  look at these lewd aprons some personal massagers  oh  looks like our amazon spa machine and a lot more fake supreme  i was gonna say soup more  oh that makes a lot more sense  swep more  swep more  sweat more  oh im already doing that and before long though supreme bags turned into supreme hats as we found a pretty exciting headgear stall where it seemed like we would be able to find a little topper for our outfits  look theyve got a bape hat right there  yeah there were many options from sports teams to street wear to designer to other  they also just have a canada hat  maybe taylor should get that one 
thats interesting  thats a power player in there  yeah laughing  canada is quite the fashion brand  listen balenciaga sit down  canadas coming for your wig  im sorry its   should i say  merkin i guess i did vow to try and make merkin a thing in  oh my merkin its flown but i dont think ive succeeded  what is a merkin 
 saphias theory is that  its a pubic wig  oh moving on as for what we were gonna choose taylor wanted to keep up the bape theme that she had been building for her look  oh it looks good on you actually
 is it good  yeah while i had a couple of brands tickle my fancy  i think i wants supreme  or fela  or von dutch but before long we found a true frontrunner  oh yes  excited gasp  tyler its the supreme ripndip collab hat though i dont actually own any supreme stuff tyler and i are quite fond of the little ripndip cat thats featured on all of their designs  the funny thing is like  the cat is like stitched so closely he looks terrifying  that is not the same ripndip cat  whats his name  lord nermal  yeah
 yeah lord nermal looks a little bit off  but its kind of perfect  it is pretty great and with our hat selected it was once again bargaining time  can you do  for both i wish i could say i was getting better at haggling but it was mostly taylor doing the legwork  whatd we get it for      for both but nonetheless i felt like we got a decent price and i was quite pleased with our finds  now you have your own  double brand thing safia  i know im very excited about it  i think im catching up  you are  im literally covered in hair  my face is just a hairball so with our head gear down we only had one category left  right now all we have left are the  underwear  and we decided to do underwear  because when we first walked in we saw a pair that we want  a pair for each of  were not going to both get into one pair  but we saw some underwear that we liked 
 that could be another video  im glad i needed clarification so to get back to the underwear shop near where we started instead of walking through the middle of the entire market again we actually went around the tents  all right  this is like the back area of all of these stalls  and it kind of does look like just a giant pillow fort theres a lot of sights and smells and sensations back there  water is falling  we just got dropped on by the air con and you were sort of made aware once again of the world outside of the market  i theres a real adidas store like right here  just walk in and show them your chanel pharrells and be like  uhh  do you  do you sell these after a few blocks of this we finally reached our entry point and readied ourselves for a mad dash to the underwear  once more into the breach dear friends once more on our way we passed a few final interesting nuggets that we hadnt noticed before  another peppa pig moment and then came upon our coveted briefs  aha ive located them 
 oh  here we are  oh yes see this is why we wanted him  i just grabbed it by the crotch which were these wonderfully misspelled pair of undies  instead of calvin klein  its calin kelun  theres also um behind you  theres chang ken i think chang keng  is that a real brand or is that just another  looks like someones hotmail address there were a couple of other options  ooh these are like silky  oh these  these are meundies but we went with the calins cuz i gotta have my calins  oh these are xxl  do you have more sizes the sizing was kind of hard to figure out as they seemed kind of small but obviously we couldnt try them on   so we purchased our undies  thank you and exited the market for the respite of the nearby sidewalk  were out so after a lot of sweating fake bags sniffing and multiple peppa pig sightings we had completed the shopping portion of our fake market hall  all right apparently theres a starbucks nearby  i want to go to there and it felt like it was about time to call it a night  all right so its the next day  and we are here with our counterfeit items  ready to have a fake fashion show  im so excited  yeah i think thats really all that needs to be said  we just weve got to go put it on in general we wanted to inspect the quality of the items and also see how close they seemed to be to the originals and even before putting them on a few things jumped out first off the tags were varying degrees of convincingness some tags looked really authentic  this looks like really pretty real whereas others put in a lot less effort  this is definitely not  i dont think this is a fendi tag  it says uh neil patrick harris on it sweet and some details like the zippers seem to be functional  as long as the zipper works were okay  like if we lose taylor inside of her bape hoodie  that would be bad today  taylor just gets lost in the upsidedown  like its secretly a portal  we zip her in  barb while other details like some of the graphics really werent looking very good  his poor nose  lord nermal  hes gotten no nose funnily enough unlike chanel pharrell and adidas supreme and ripndip dont actually have a collab together so beyond not having a nose lord nermal also doesnt have this collab  hes just a little you know  he just needs some love so after a first inspection sweep it was time to try on our outfits and we immediately ran into an issue with the calin kelun underwear  we heard something whats going on which was shockingly small  these are extralarge and also weirdly lowcut at the butt crack  i dont know how to show you this  without getting demonitized  but it also doesnt really cover my entire bootie  like it stops like halfway like yeah  this is the top of it which effectively crushed my hopes for a boxers peeping over the top of my pants moment  damn it calin  i was gonna make a whole bit about my calins  but now i cant so its fine  now im gonna just walk like this for the rest of the day
 should i do the triple xl  maybe that one will fit you because it does not fit me  and then we can show at least one so underwear aside i threw on the rest of my outfit and sauntered out of the bathroom  oooooh  wow  whats good  as they say  here i am just a hype beast  in my natural habitat and taylor quickly joined the party  yes  head to toe bape and i gotta be honest that from a distance our outfits looked okay  i feel like we look really good together  like i think um we definitely dont look that bad  yeah okay
 is what ill say but i feel like thats sort of the name of the game with these fake items like from far away they might pass but the devils in the details as for taylors outfit the pros were that her bape sweat suit and her chanel pharell adidas shoes were pretty comfortable the details on her hat looked reasonably legit and she was able to fit into the triple xl calin keluns  i dont think tyler you or i will be able to wear them  because this was the bigger size that we got but the big question mark about taylors outfit was were we gonna be able to zip her fully inside her hoodie  farewell taylor  this is like kenny from south park  it was nice knowing you  oh no lets not get the bangs in there  oh no  im nervous and let me tell you it was not easy  this feels dangerous reason
 oh  oh okay
 it is kinda tight on her head  shes got like a small head syndrome right now whats weird is the body of the hoodie fit her pretty well but the proportions of the hood is seemed bizarrely smaller  can you breathe it all in there  i can breathe  yeah  let me know when you want to come out and though im not sure youre supposed to spend a ton of time inside of real bape hoodies i think the fake one seems a bit more claustrophobic  welcome back to reality  oh there goes gravity  you feel better  yeah 
 here let me give you your hat back  was it hot in there  it was hot in there now as for my black and yellow almost pittsburgh steelers fan outfit i did kind of purposefully purchase the more messed up logos like the baienglacas  ah hell yeah and the dor bag  i mean they just threw some ds on it and now its dior  throw some ds on it
 yeah  thats what i was saying yeah  i made the joke so obviously those arent good fakes besides that though i was reasonably comfortable i thought my fendi shirt looked pretty good and no it didnt feel like a nice tshirt it wasnt overtly itchy as for the bottoms  the offwhite sweatpants are actually like not so bad  the  this ribbon on the side is quite nice besides the quality though the fit of the sweatpants were slightly awkward  heres the thing  is that like these are the mediums  and i probably in real life could have used a large  but the large that she was trying to show me  seemed much longer  and like a lot bigger  i could have used like a medium and a half so all in all i would say that my outfit was poorly embroidered sized and spelled but the sweatpants exceeded my expectations and after hulking through our calin keluns almost suffocating taylor with her hoodie and doing a horribly lit fashion show in the hallway  yeah youre really backlit  can you see me at all  barely  it doesnt help that im wearing all black  not really and then also the illusion has been broken  i saw taylor in the background i guess that concluded our counterfeit market hall  i would say this was pretty successful  i had so much fun  it was it was a time in general i thought that the fake market itself though sweltering and crowded was pretty fun and i thoroughly enjoyed all of the like random finds we stumbled upon however in terms of our actual items they ended up being pretty hit or miss overall its not great quality stuff  the chain feels very cheap too  oh its a little light  yeah
 its almost like its hollow and im not really sure that any of these items would actually pass under closer inspection especially with people who might know the brands better and care if its designer or not so youre probably better off spending the same amount of money or less on not actually designer stuff but better quality than fake stuff i will say it was interesting though to see what the vendors at the fake market thought was popular enough to sell counterfeits of which i guess i would summarize as like a lot of supreme a little bit of pharrell and a dash of artisanal fidgets spinner  now i almost want to go there to figure out what is trending and whats popular with kids  because i didnt know these things existed so all in all i would not recommend buying fake stuff because besides being kind of illegal youre probably not gonna get something good but i would definitely recommend visiting the ladies market if youre ever in hong kong if nothing else just to see the sights and if you really want to buy something maybe you can pick yourself up a pair of fish flops see i told you i had a pair thank you guys so much for watching and once again a huge thank you to taylor and natalie for accompanying us to the fake market if you like that video make sure to smash that like button and if you want to see more videos like this make sure to smash subscribe button a big shout out to aurora for watching thanks for watching aurora and i will see you guys a next time  hello friends and welcome to another video this week im gonna be getting a kpop style makeover and maybe even becoming a bonafide kpop stan now if youve been basically anywhere on the internet at all over the last couple of years youve probably been exposed to kpop from stan wars on twitter to meme compilation videos on youtube as well as legions of confused bts fans on any behindthescenes videos but regardless its true that kpop or korean pop music has gone from popular internationally to like explosive internationally with performance and music videos garnering hundreds of millions of views and groups like bts and blackpink going on world tours headlining major music festivals and appearing on every latenight talk show imaginable hey jimmy yeah im jimin and besides the highly polished singing and dancing and the extremely extra music videos another huge element of kpop is the style as in the numerous overthetop fashions that their stars wear in music videos and during performances like neon feather tube tops what look like baby blue thighhigh uggs and everchanging pastel hair colors so i figured that our travels to south korea this year would be a perfect opportunity for me to get my own dramatic kpopstyle makeover and to do this were gonna be teaming up with a whole squad of stylists in seoul who have worked with actual kpop artists before to help me achieve a head to toe look an outfit hair and makeup and maybe along the way well be able to answer the ageold questions of just why is kpop so popular what actually is gangnam style anyway and most importantly john cena are you army alright lets go now as someone who didnt know a whole lot about kpop before making this video i tried to do my research before our trip to seoul and this is sort of what i got a feel for in terms of like how the industry works as a quick disclaimer though i am still new to this so i dont mean to offend any stans if for whatever reason we dont include specific groups or performers please dont come for my wig or my merkin so basically the kpop industry is run by like a handful of production companies that sort of put together boy and girl groups from pools of young trainees through like a very rigorous selection process and once these groups debut after years of practicing and polishing these production companies basically manage them schedule their many appearances and performances and produce their albums their music videos and also their like vlogstyle reality shows grr
all done rrah
finished i know his face there are solo performers as well but theres a lot of focus on the groups and besides being performers these kpop stars also known as idols also become major influencers with their looks their style as well as with the products they promote with some idols even getting sponsorships to wear certain things to the airport its called airport fashion and you really witness their omnipresence firsthand as soon as you land in seoul because pretty much everywhere you turn there is kpop from bank ads to contact lens merchants to adjacent skincare stores and i heard from some people in seoul that you know a kpop idol has made it when they have a chicken sponsorship bbq obviously every country uses celebrities to promote products and places but its an impressive spread and because these idols can be so influential their images are quite carefully curated by master stylists who pretty much dress them from headtotoe for every occasion so to start our makeover we were gonna be visiting a kpop stylist who was gonna help me pick out my outfit so in seoul we were staying in  myeongdong area which is a touristy but fun and busy shopping neighborhood but to meet up with our stylist we had to cross the han river to get to the gangnam area yes that gangnam so we were joined by our friend hojusara a seoulbased youtuber hello im korean loving hojusara as well as a selfproclaimed kpop stan who was going to be acting as our guide and translator so we hopped on the subway to get across town sara so were going to the gangnam area but specifically apgujeong which is in gangnam cause gangnams massive so theres like a small part of it gangnam is definitely a nicer part of seoul but its more of a general term than i originally thought i guess its less like the upper east side and more like saying the entire island of manhattan so on our way over there i asked sara as a kpop fan what she thought was a current trend that our stylist might put me in sara i feel like and maybe its just i really hope that they put you in like a leather harness cause i see so much of that like in kpop on like the posters and seeing as you really love black i feel like you would work well with the kind of like combat boot look safiya like the lara croft i had actually noticed this trend a bit as well and i would not have been opposed to something like that sara i wanna see it yeah i wanna see lots and lots of leather straps safiya and if we dont get leather straps today you know we can always just do that on our own  thats kinkycareful sof there are kids watching so after about thirty minutes on the train we arrived in apgujeong and walked over to the fashionable clothing boutique boy where we were going to be meeting our stylist ms jung and ms jung has worked with popular acts such as sunmi april kard fromis9 as well as and she picked out this store in particular because its frequented by a lot of kpop stylists for everything from outrageous music video looks to more toneddown street wear safiya ohh safiya so we have everything in here ms jung yeah safiya awesome the clothes in this shop are also inspired by current kpop stars with different sections themed around the signature styles and concepts of different groups safiya mhm like plaid and houndstooth patterns inspired by the popular girl group twice a section of bold and shiny statement pieces safiya whoa heheheh thats awesome as well as on the other side of the store cute and preppy looks inspired by groups like weki meki who is one of the groups that ms jung styles safiya yeah ive been stalking your instagram sara shes like theres only my son on there safiya yeah hes so cute ms jung ah yeah thank you safiya very stylish and apparently pastel colors and gingham skirts are quite a popular look for kpop girl groups boy also has a healthy dose of just generally trendy stuff like bright neon colors sara its like the biggest trend in korea at the moment its like the neons particularly neon green theres a lot
ms jung yes but i feel like the division in the store between the swaggy and the sweet stuff sort of reflects the two major poles of kpop female idol fashion like a cutesy youthful look stan loona or like a sexy glam tougher style and a lot of the groups seem to sort of evolve through the different styles like starting off kind of schoolgirl and then becoming more glamorous or like mixing up their fashion to match the different concepts of their songs safiya what is your preferred style that you like to put artists in sara the choreography
ms jung choreography sara its more fun to do
ms jung yeah so with all of that explained it was time to jump in safiya alright so shall we pick out some outfits ms jung alright okay we were gonna pick out three options to try on and then choose one to be our final outfit and first up was a summery lime green look safiya oh thats great safiya oh like a crossbody fanny pack
ms jung yes yes yes yes and i guess we were considering this sort of our trendy neon option tyler you look like a melon safiya well i havent even worn it yet ms jung no tyler its good sara theres an ice cream in korea called melona which is like this bright like green ice cream and i just likeits that safiya ill look very tasty safiya alright perfect awesome option 1 ms jung yeah option 1 next up we wanted to pick out a toughglam outfit and much to saras delight waiting for us on that rack was a leather harness ready to be paired with a shiny cropped jacket safiya yesss as well as a red top with black buckle accents safiya yeah i think i could probably squeeze into it to complete our second look safiya alright so this is thewhat do you call this sexy ms jung yeah
safiya the sexy look safiya mm yeah then we zipped over to the other side of the store safiya just sneakin in just holding my haul to find our third option which was supposed to be a sweet and preppy look that included a pink matching sweater set and a little pink beret safiya yeah safiya is this a good look and with our options in hand safiya where where am i going this way
ms jung there there safiya there this way i was sent off to the dressing room safiya alright im gonna go try this on one at a time not all at once and first up was our trendy neon green look tyler oh wow
safiya hello ms jung very cute safiya i am the melon ice cream safiya oh wow this is cool tyler this is really cool safiya this is very different what do you think safiya very cute ms jung had mentioned that a big reason that lime green is so much in the uh limelight is that pantone selected it as a trending color of the summer safiya oh it does thank you in addition to the green dress we also added a bunch of bright barrettes which seem to be popular amongst kpop idols as well as a pair of my own nike sneakers that i brought from home as it seems like its also a trend to pair flowy dresses with chunky sneakers or dad shoes as for me i actually really liked the lime green safiya i think it makes it not so girly you know what i mean its a little bit like a cool color and the outfit itself seemed decently comfortable for summer safiya its not too tight i feel like a cool breeze im likin it but although it was a fun look we were ready to see something a little more dramatic safiya which one shall we do next safiya ah yes the harness one you might have to help me get into it i dunno which way i go in
ms jung okay how do i enter it and as i predicted i did actually need a fair amount of help but after some finagling i eventually got in and barged out of the dressing room safiya what do you think safiya yeah is this a vibe oh my wow wow wow i was a tall drink of fruity pebbles safiya this jacket is amazing safiya i am obsessed with this jacket
tyler yeah in addition to the things we had picked out i was also wearing my own cargo pants that i had brought from home as backup just in case my thighs were too juicy for the kpop idol sizes sara right right shes like it really suits you i agree
safiya yeah ms jung yeah
sara can you please wear that as airport fashion safiya yes safiya spotted at airport in unknown harness situation safiya yeah thats true the harness trend in kpop has been around for a little while not necessarily started but definitely memed into oblivion as a result of btss use of leather body harnesses during their fake love era and since then variations on the harness have been seen on boy and girl groups alike including our outfit inspo blackpink who rock a lara croftseductive seatbelt vibe in their kill this love music video sara so this is the kind of thing people would wear like at a concert or something you know its a very popular style for concerts cause its very visual
safiya mm sara oh and also the lighting picks up on it really well safiya mm
sara like the concert lighting safiya yeah i definitely see that i feel like from far away i could be seen safiya yeah no its not a kpop move its just my dance move overall i think we all liked it sara its like a sexy train conductor and i think beyond just wow there were a lot of things to say about it safiya i have a very vague like marching band feel ms jung oh yeah marching band
safiya cause of the hat yeah like kinda like a safiya but like a fashionable marching band person but before we got too attached we had to try on our final option safiya yeah lets try on the third one shall we now i did encounter a bit of a speed bump when trying on the third outfit and that bump was my booty because the pink skirt was really not gonna make it over the hill so in lieu of hulking out of the sweater set ms jung picked out an alternative girlish cute look for me that could work with one of the miniskirts i had brought from home safiya what do you think safiya i havent seen myself so i cant say anything safiya oh more more bags now aside from the crossbody bag this new option consisted of a short sleeve button down with heartshaped buttons a plaid beret and cherry statement earrings along with my houndstooth skirt and chunky white sneakers safiya oh
tyler yeah safiya oh its very cute oh i love it actually i love the bag and i think we were all kind of digging the look sara it really does it seems like this was the most typical kpop girl group look out of all of our options safiya i like the sort of like slight puff at the shoulder safiya oh like a little cap sleeve kind of
tyler yeah and i was feeling pretty peppy and preppy safiya yeah i kind of look like a very cute golfer you know what i mean safiya ohh yeah safiya should we go golfing sara now i cant unsee it
safiya yeah and i think this one was actually a pretty strong contender to be our final outfit safiya i think my two favorites are this look and then the previous look with the harness what do you think safiya oh yeah so although this was more of a traditional girl group style i think we were all fans of the sexy train conductor look safiya i think we had the harness in mind when we came in so to leave without a harness would be a shame and besides the harness trend the other elements of the outfit actually also played into different kpop themes like the tinsel fringe being good for movement in performances and the cargo pant actually being a trend itself as like an alternative girl idol look and i definitely feel some blackpink spirit in it kind of like lisaish because they seem to put her in pants a lot but i also see shades of other girl groups like red velvet idle and itzy amongst others safiya so next up we have to get a makeup and a hair look
ms jung oh and then we can complete our kpop makeover and then go out into seoul and see what people think of me i guess so we thanked the marvelous ms jung for all of her help safiya oh im glad and moved onwards to the next phase of our makeover so the next day we headed over once again to gangnam but this time to the cheongdam neighborhood to get to jenny house primo which is a very impressive multistoried gold and marble luxury beauty salon which has been visited by a fair amount of korean celebrities like kpop groups wanna one ioi seventeen vixx and tvxq and for my makeover we were gonna be working with hair stylist taesung and makeup artist in ha they had given us our own room on the top floor that featured two vanities teeming with makeup safiya im very excited theres like such an intense spread to my left right here like ive never seen this much makeup out except for maybe when we make our like crazy melting makeup series so i kind of feel like were gonna make like a korean frakenblush right now but i know thats not the point of whats happening safiya no thats not what were gonna be doing and they were gonna be taking a simultaneous pass at my face and my hair so its all just gonna be like one segment theyre all just gonna attack me me at once safiya alright should we get started taesung lets go safiya awesome so they started prepping me from the ground up safiya im being groomed shampooing and blowdrying my hair as well as cleansing and applying serums to my skin safiya is the smacking to help it get in sara its so it absorbs into your skin better safiya yeah its a loving slap safiya a love tap and once i was fully prepped it was time to make a game plan saf for the makeup what kind of look are we going for now for my face in ha wanted to make sure that the makeup matched the glam vibe of our outfit sara so like a more stronger idol makeup look she was thinking i think in general kpop makeup tends to mirror a lot of kbeauty trends which favor clear dewy skin rosy stained lips and usually warmertoned eyeshadow looks but for today we were gonna be adding a bit more color and shimmer and just generally turning up the volume sara so for you today shes gonna go with like a burgundy look
safiya awesome sara which i think would go really well with like the red and everything safiya yeah and the purple tinsel jacket as for my hair taesung also had some fancy ideas he had seen a hairstyle on jennie from blackpink that he was inspired by which was kind of like a halfup halfdown look with long wavy tresses sara so theyve prepared extensions for you to add in
safiya oh safiya that looks good there are a lot of different hair looks in kpop but i would say that female idols tend to have long hair that they can swish around so extensions were not a bad idea but given that everything was happening at once were gonna explain the makeup first and in ha started off by slathering me with some foundation safiya she is kind of buttering me with like a dull knife but i like it to achieve that even dewy complexion after that we moved on to pink and peach shimmery eyeshadow and dark brown smudged eyeliner she then proceeded to flame and approach my eyelashes with a wooden skewer safiya whoa what was that sara so this is really common in korea because they were like if you heat the eyelashes they curl better i had never heard of this before and though it was slightly scary it was also pretty cool safiya i smell toasted safiya it looks good in addition to that in ha added some small iridescent sequins on my lower lash line sara its a trend in kind of like crystals or like pearls like around the eyes and this eye bling trend has been seen on male and female idols notably on singer chungha safiya do they look like beautiful tears tyler kind of
safiya yeah im like emotional after that in ha added some fake lashes and then barbecued those too safiya more roasting safiya yes more roasting from there she tried to tame my overgrown eyenbrow hedges safiya oh im getting chopped and then finally she added a pink moussey lip color to finish off my face in ha okay
safiya yeah safiya awesome what do you think ty tyler you look great
safiya i love it i was really pleased with how the makeup turned out but we didnt have too much time to dwell on it right then as taesung had just been rolling right along with my hair adding the extensions in kind of section by section sara its looking very lush back here safiya i can feel it i feel something growing besides long hair taesung mentioned that another big thing in kpop hair is dyeing it a lot sara so theres like a lot of like really vivid colors that they dye their hair tyler which is why were making your hair blue today safiya that wasnt actually our plan but i was curious as to what color taesung would recommend for me if i was actually an idol sara he was like um so a red but not like a deep red more like a pastel red safiya mm
sara like with a lot of white as a base safiya ohh but returning to our jennie hairstyle we started floofing the hair at the crown of my head safiya i like the volume im seeing up here for one moment its  and spraying down my waves safiya i feel like a mermaid ope now i feel like im in an aquarium oh heyo im back oh im back ope nope just kidding good bye next he pulled back the hair from the top part of my head to create that halfup look and then turned his attention to styling the baby hairs around my face safiya oh hes curling my sideburns its happening theyre being incorporated into the look im pleased from there he started crafting our top bun which was supposed to look sort of like a blooming rose sprouting from my scalp safiya its so cute i love it its just a lil baby bun oh yeah spray that sucker down taesung then went into a sort of snipping mode sara are you alright if he cuts these little bits here
safiya sure sara its quite a like popular trend in korea at the moment safiya oh
sara it looks a bit cuter and it makes your face look smaller and there were no tendrils left untrimmed safiya are my sideburns the right length though sara hes like oh i can cut the bottom of it then safiya if you want to yeah
sara oh sara done
safiya oh sara it happened taesung byebye safiya just a lil snip i was then declared almost finished safiya so now im just gonna go put on my outfit and then well do like final touches at the end just to make sure i didnt mess it up by putting on my harness so i headed back to the dressing room and sara volunteered as tribute to help me get buckled up safiya just gettin strapped in and i think we figured out that youre actually supposed to step in to the harness so the straps kind of lay on your hips rather than just being threaded through your groin sara because then youre supposed to hang like suspenders or something from there i was thinking it was too crotchbased yesterday which i think was mostly my bad safiya like we were having a hard time figuring it out and then i was like oh lets put it here but regardless we eventually got the harness on properly tyler youre like a bts meme right now right you got all the
safiya oh i thought you were gonna say btsm tyler no
safiya thats where my head was at tyler that was better and i think it was all starting to come together safiya watch out im approaching your area its supposed to be a blackpink sort of reference tyler it made sense to me it did actually
sara i got that i got that blackpinks in the area shes coming to your area so i donned my glittery jacket safiya hello and returned to the chair to get finished off taesung wow
sara theyre saying its so pretty safiya oh you like it
taesung wow taesung unbelievable i was glad to hear that taesung and in ha were fans of the outfit sara if you walk around like this people are gonna think that youre like a foreign idol
safiya mm tyler youre from the exotic land of glendale and after some final curling safiya oh hold on sorry the jackets coming in and a little glitter in the eyebrows our look was done taesung okay finished
safiya completely finished taesung yeah
safiya wow safiya i love it ive been looking at myself for a while so its not like a reveal its not like im like oh my god look at it no ive been looking at it it looks so good overall i was really impressed by the hair and makeup transformation that had occured on my head in particular i really liked the stainedlooking lips as well as the rhinestones around the eyes and the extensions and the top bun really had me feeling stageready plus the sideburn trim was a nice bonus so we thanked taesung and in ha for all of their help safiya yeah awesome and stepped outside to see the full outfit in all its glory which after all of our shopping slapping and snipping ended up being a tendriledstrapped blackpinkinspired ensemble that made me feel both like an idol and also like a wall of glitter safiya so now that we have our final kpop makeover look its time to wander around seoul and do some sort of kpop idolish things in particular we had outlined a few locations to visit that are kpop related andor frequented by kpop idols and our first stop was sm entertainment one of the large kpop production companies who rep groups like red velvet exo and girls generation in addition to being like where groups actually come to practice and record smtown also has a café out front where fans hang out hoping to catch a glimpse of their favorite idol tyler cause youre dressed like that theyre like we dont want you out there and on their café menu they have idolthemed items like red velvet cupcakes tyler skewer it im gonna shotgun that thing as like merch for the different members of red velvet safiya mmm its so good they also designate on the menu which items are certain groups favorites so you can drink what they drink tyler ah besides the café they also have a pretty deckedout gift shop on the same floor selling like their groups posters albums and concert cheering sticks tyler yeah youre holding it like that which is what the fans will wave around in the audience during performances overall i really enjoyed my visit to the sm headquarters tyler the similarities are uncanny whether they enjoyed me visiting or not but it was time for us to move on to our d destination so we hopped into a cab and headed across gangnam to the next stop on our proverbial kpop map of fame safiya alright safiya so now a lot of bts fans come here tyler like us laundry pizza is first and foremost a pizza restaurant with like laundomatthemed decor but over the last couple of years its also been a popular place for kpop groups to shoot music videos or do photoshoots so its sort of evolved into an instagram destination where people go to like generally soak in btss aura and pose like them im not sure if i successfully recreated their shoot but we did eat some pizza and i also did some dancing that no one requested tyler no no youre not so from there we went on our way catching a little bit of afternoon sun safiya wait where is it there we go there we go
tyler and there it is and then bopping over to stop number three our final destination of the day ddp or dongdaemun design plaza which is sort of like this huge silver spaceshiplooking building where they host seoul fashion week kpop award shows and also i think like a generally popular place to be photographed take photographs and pose tyler and maybe even film kpop music videos
safiya yes definitely safiya but like matured tyler if the bean sprouted
safiya thats not bad so after taking a few futuristiclooking instagrams we attempted a couple of mediumexecuted slowmo walks kind of to mimic a music video shot tyler i dont i dont know which did actually showcase the outfit pretty well like the tinsel was flowing the straps were containing the sideburns were windswept and there was even an opportunity for a scandalous jiminstyle shoulder reveal but unfortunately while all wrapped up in the moment we forgot about tyler tyler yeah fk and after tyler absolutely ate it on like a bollard or something it seemed about time to wrap it up tyler alright you wanna rock and roll okay so that was my kpop makeover overall i had a bit of a blast in the outfit and a great time bouncing around seoul safiya whoa and i feel like i learned a lot about kpop style and some of the tropes that they use to like express the different tones of the groups and performers tyler this is swag i think i actually liked everything about this look to be honest my only real complaint was that the jacket got a bit frazzled and crimped getting in and out of cabs all day so i think it might be meant more for like a single threeminute performance now i will admit that while doing our research i have fallen down the kpop suggested video rabbit hole and become a kpop stan which sort of has helped me develop a working theory as to just why kpop might be so popular now in general kpops international reach is considered to be part of whats known as hallyu or the korean wave aka the increased relevance of south korean pop culture on the global stage since the late  but as for its more recent explosiveness in the west i think that youtube itself is playing a huge role because once you click on one video theres so much kpop content on the platform to algorithmically refer to you its hard not to get sucked in because you can just keep watching from performances to dance practices to korean variety shows its sort of easy for your entire homepage to just turn into kpop and on top of that theres also legions of eager fans on the platform trying to promote their faves by adding subtitles to any and every video they can and making countless compilation and meme videos to contribute to the stream in fact when i think about it its actually almost miraculous that i havent fallen into the kpop hole until now but i am happy to be here i guess you could say this is my debut i think next up on my kpop checklist is to 1 start wearing more harnesses and 2 learn how to dance just for everyones benefit thank you guys so much for watching and once again a huge thank you to sara ms jung taesung and in ha for all of their help with our makeover and also to boy jenny house and the sm cafe for allowing us to film if you liked that video make

for watching trixie and i will see you guys anext time hello friends and welcome to another video this week were going to be going to a korean cheese theme park yes you heard that right cheese so a few months ago while we were planning our trip to east asia i stumbled upon a few articles about a cheese theme park in imsil south korea and immediately i was intrigued i mean mainly because i love cheese i like gouda i like goat cheese and a good mozzarella never hurt so i was extremely curious as to what goes on at a cheese theme park and how much of it is edible however after doing more research im still not sure i really know because besides those few articles written by people who i dont think have ever been to the park theres not a ton of info out there but based on what i could figure out and what google autotranslate helped me figure out i do know that there are  acres filled with cheese shaped buildings a cheese palace a cheese slide and cheese making classes so i figured we had to check it out for ourselves now seoul south korea was stop 2 for us on our asia trip after tokyo where we also shot and produced a couple of videos and while in seoul we stayed in the myeongdong area which is like a somewhat touristy but also super fun neighborhood with a lot of shopping alleyways street food and skincare stores but as good as the food was in myeongdong oooohhhmy word we were really craving some cheese now as we mentioned the cheese theme park is in a town called imsil which is about a three hour train ride south of seoul and to make sure we didnt just get lost in the korean countryside we were aided by our friend hoju sara who is a seoulbased youtuber who makes videos in korean as well as videos in english she and her cameraman had been helping us produce our videos in korea as well as acting as our proverbial guides while we were there i think it looks amazing i kinda look like yoda so they had let the park know that we were coming and that they were also coming with us and to get to the park and back in one day we had to catch a very early train so we got up at 7 am and jumped into a taxicab to get to yongsan station now on the way tyler made friends with our cab driver and almost accidentally gave our camera to him good yeah i think tyler was a little lost in translation thank you no no our driver also had a pair of scissors in the car that he used to trim some of tylers leg hair but unfortunately we have no footage of that he did eventually give us our camera back and dropped us off at the train station overall he was pretty cool 
you ready for cheese
im ready for cheese im ready for the cheese is this place even real 
i dont know yeah okay its real then
so there is someone there doing something
yeah so youll just get your make up done
yes
youll just barely finish your makeup
yeah ah lets do it
are you roasting me right now so after wandering around and grabbing some coffee at the station we hopped on the train and began our lengthy ride down the korean peninsula just fancying myself up for the cheese that cheese could be the new tea
oh my god give me the cheese and after many stops failed nap attempts and a few more hours our destination finally arrived so we hopped off the train we have arrived and quickly realized that we were not in seoul anymore metaphorically speaking are we like the only people that got off the train theres like  people okay got it some people also got on really maybe theyre out of here something we also noticed almost right away is that the cheese theme in imsil is not just contained within the park oh yeah like cheese was everywhere including on the taxi that we took from the station to the actual theme park which as we drove up was looking pretty legit so we got out of the car and made landfall or should i say swiss fall okay so we are at the imsil cheese theme park now with sara aka hoju sara did i say that right close enough close enough close enough ah yes so this is the aforementioned sara she was also on the train with us and we were going to introduce her on the train but then the train got quite crowded so i felt like you know well just keep her a secret until now sara is also australian in case anyone is wondering about the accent see there you go now after a quick initial survey of the park this place is pretty huge its built on like a big hill so theres a fair amount of climbing required  it has a large circular path that leads you to the different attractions from my count there are two cheeseshaped structures a bunch of cute sort of europeanstyle buildings and a giant cheese palace in the middle with a large versaillesstyle garden out front that has some sort of renaissance replica sculptures there are also many character tableaus throughout the park some that feature familiar faces do the smurfs know these are here and some that seem to be imsils own original ip is that cheese making cheese what kind of witchcraft is this like this crown head cheese guy who is displayed everywhere and where they dont put that dude they just add some like swiss holes to things to bring a little cheese to the decour theres a lot to see a lot of cats ive noticed in the last like ten minutes im not sure if the cheese brings the mice and then the mice brings the cats but there were a lot of cats but before we could really take off and explore the whole place we had signed up to participate in a few cheese experiences i think we should go yeah yeah were running late theyre up like this hill theyre like somewhere over there so weve scurried across the park to the experience hall i had signed us up for experience course c which included pizza making as well as two different cheese making classes and we arrived just in time to wash our hands and put on some aprons its why i look like a decoration and then we were whisked into the classroom now i will say that although we didnt know exactly what the cheese park was gonna be like i did sort of think it was going to be like a winetasting moment like going to a vineyard but for cheese but immediately after walking into the room for our pizza making class i realized i was oh so wrong i think we were definitely the oldest people in the classroom that werent also accompanied by a child there was a group of boisterous preteens in the corner but we were a good  years older than them the other thing besides the age demo that sort of surprised me was that the cheese instructor at the front of the room had a microphone headset on and was sort of shouting instructions at us very rapidly and in korean of course so sara and her cameraman were sort of scrambling to translate what was going on so all of that aside we started making our pizza which included flattening the dough they gave us and then brushing the edges with cheese oil after that it was sauce time and we used our ladles to spread it around which sarah seemed to be a natural at after that we drizzled on our cheese and our meats and then we were directed to start cutting our vegetables with surprisingly sharp knives which startled both tyler and me and after adding a variety of fix ins including potato we were pretty much done with our pizzas so we posed with our finished pies and then plated them to go into the oven now it turned out that after the pizza it was time for a powerpoint presentation about the history of imsil cheese whats actually pretty interesting about imsil is that cheese is not traditionally a part of korean cuisine and by everything ive read was actually introduced into korea via imsil in the  the story goes that in the  there was a belgian missionary who settled in the imsil area who raised goats and made his own cheese the local governor thought it might be a good idea for the whole community to learn the craft so he asked the missionary to teach the town his cheese making skills and from there imsil became the cheese mecca of korea and the main domestic producer of the stuff so after the presentation it was time to move on to the actual cheese making first up was a sort of chemistry based class where they gave us a jar of warm milk and a couple of enzymes to add in to like curdle it after we had created our beginners cheeseinajar we shredded it strained it and then mashed it together into a blob and after slicing we put our cheese onto crackers so we could have our first tasting of the day and it was pretty good not a sharp cheese but rather a soft and light and slightly wet cheese but regardless i think we were all happy to be accomplishing our primary objective of the day eating stuff very quickly up next we were ready to move on to cheese number two which was a premade cheese that we were going to stretch so to start off we were presented with a large mixing bowl full of cheese to shred once we had ripped up our cheese it was time to melt it down so we mashed our bits together and made a big blob to stretch out into sort of a cheese parachute which didnt go very well after that we were supposed to squeeze our cheese into a long tube kind of like giant flaccid string cheese and though our dairy snake was kind of falling apart the cheese instructor who was helping us just started feeding us handfuls of the stuff which was exactly the bring me the cheese moment i was waiting for both  with the slightly sharper taste and also with the warmth and meltyness after taking some lactose to the face we packaged our string cheese to take home with the imsil dudes seal of approval right on top we also grabbed our pizzas that had been baking the entire time and once we had our haul we were ready to head back outside and have ourselves a little picnic okay so that was like a day and a half of like cheese and pizza making classes speed cheese making i mean it wasnt experience they they totally didnt do what they promised i dont know if it was audible at all but saf described it as like a soul cycle class for cheese making yes  this is how you make pizza this is how you do it but regardless of the format of the class they did deliver on the cheese front they promised us cheese we got cheese   yes at multiple points so that was good well i think claire was filming at one point and they just put cheese in her mouth so but despite our multiple cheese appetizers we were definitely ready for the entrees  yeah oh its so cute and perfect i love it oh my god its adorable oh my god i do not think it looked this good when it went in  it didnt and then we opened up saras pizza which was also looking pretty tasty     i found this task quite difficult on account of the blustery day i just feel like this is just as fashionable as i can get really yeah but then it was time to taste test our creations cheers cheese im not sure what that was though its like one of those ads where someone like takes up bite of something and the wind like just bursts into their face like this is the best pizza ever okay its quite good actually uh no really this is really good ill eat the other half this is awesome we did a great job we did an excellent job but before we just inhaled the pizzas can i come in there for a piece of pizza yeah we gave tyler some as well   potatoes and i think he liked it too oh yeah yeah oh thats amazing its quite good its worth a our flight or at least you know it was worth the additional 4 hour train ride from seoul all right so now that we have eaten some of our pizza sounds good to me yeah you just want to finish im gonna keep eating as we explore so we set off around the parks circular paths to investigate all of the different buildings and attractions what is going on up there is that like sound of music or something theres a lot of sound of music stuff going on so i feel like its possible yeah its cute though its very cute but instead of going up the hill we decided to start with the right side of the park alright lets go through this way there were actually two cheese hearts one that was sort of holy it is good it is cute and one that was served on a very large plate with utensils to match cue montage of me attempting to make cheese heart puns my heart would be blue cheese without you know i dont like blue cheese you are gouda to me this went on for a while quick sara give me a type of cheese if you leave me i come in there oh that was really good how did you think of that has it been preloaded this whole time oh okay good you could have just lied there you go okay hey and with the heart that works well okay cool youll even give me a high five on that one yeah i gave you a one four seven yeah directly across from the plated cheese heart was another building so theres a random laser tag just over there but not cheese themed its an interesting addendum to the cheese themepark theyre like we have giant heart cheeses and then we have laser tag brings a new meaning to dangerously cheesy oh my god please walk off screen you can leave too sarah thats why are you here though we didnt have quite enough of a quorum for a good laser tag match we did go in and check it out okay this is like the laser tag course and sarah was right that it wasnt really cheesy laser tag if anything id say its more like wild west theme its kind of cool but it did give us a good view of the marquee wheel of cheese across the park i like you i like the giant wheel of cheese just looming its like hes trying to eat the sound of music kids over there he did look like a giant like pacman pacman yeah so after that we continued up the path to a large clock tower that had fake swiss guards standing outside of it a la the vatican he looks a lot like john cena doesnt he oh i see it im picking up what youre putting down inside of the clock tower they had a trick eye museum or like forced perspective vignettes for people to take pictures with including a cheese up scenario honestly no but i like the idea i dont know why theres a goat there i couldnt really figure this one out besides that one there was like a painting come to life scenario oh see that one looks quite good i dont think thats monet a ferrari zipping through the countryside scene look at you what are you sponsored by seat geek and a venetian gondola sticking out of the wall i would recommend more cheese in here we the flying cheese up display but i feel like the ferrari could at least be made out of cheese okay you validated it all behind the trick eye museum there was a pretty quiet courtyard that had a few little cafes a large empty stage a small hotel in case you want to spend the night on the premises and a cheese aging building that was kind of like a chilled stone room with a bit of a wine cellar vibe it was kind of romantic this room did actually feature a wine and cheese tasting area these are the adult cheese making rooms that was more like what i had expected the whole park to be like originally like gourmet snacking while wheels of cheese aged in the background all right weve got a little bit of adult cheese we could have had it with wine but it is sort of opening use drop it i literally just oh i drop the cheese into my birkin stocking yes sarah was stonecold sober when she dropped the cheese into my shoe we did eventually get to taste the cheese though hmm thats what a sharp cheese and it was quite delicious thats a good cheese it would go well with wine its true after the adult area we followed the path back towards the center of the park but instead of turning down to the cheese palace which by the way i think is mostly a food court we turned uphill to the sound of music tableau where we found some large alpine horns and a stationary rickshaw do you saw cycle we did eventually reach the top of the hill where we encountered a slightly  going on  style gazebo and then of course you have gradually and ruth and all the kids well actually only a few of the kids i guess the von trapps are not really cheese related but they are sort of swiss adjacent so maybe thats why theyre so prominently featured i think we have two things so from there we continued onwards to the muchanticipated cheese slide here this actually does make it more of a theme park yeah they do have like a sort of roller coaster yeah no hes not and after scaring away the rest of the line i hopped on the slide alright see you later oh why is it so loud its actually quite a lengthy ride and its made up of a bunch of small metal rollers that clink around and do a number on your booty oh my god youre not going very fast my butts getting massaged like crazy that sounds nice how was it nah hes way far hes way far oh my god hows your butt oh like shiatsu massage that didnt stop tyler from trying his hand or rather his behind at the slide as well is he going faster than me or slower i think i was going faster maybe im wrong though oh but but still shaken right and to complete the tripod sarah who had been exploring elsewhere for a moment rejoined us at the slide and plopped right on then this is what happens when shes goes to your large intestines oh my god i dont think that when sarah dressed to match the cheese she expected digestion imagery to come out of it i was trying to get the speed and it didnt work hows your butt feeling hot wedgie though we all did enjoy the slide i think that it could have benefitted from having like a tray to sit on rather than just having legs straight onto rollers but it was definitely a good addition to the park theres a ride its a theme park if theres a ride with a theme it is a theme park was this people kept smacking their heads on i think cuz they put this on it yeah behind the slide there were a few pastures with goats in them whats up hey buddy this guys coming down he wants to hang out i think thats a woman hello maam whose udders seemed pretty full and ready for more cheese making three squeezes and i will drain you okay bite dwight so with the back side of the park investigated and our backsides raw it was finally time to visit the marquee cheese shaped building oh there it is we are approaching the big cheese its kind of like the great pumpkin from charlie brown i feel like its been calling us this whole time its like mount doom now once you get inside the wheel of cheese there are two different floors the lower floor is indoors and has a couple of interactive walls what about the cheese cycle featuring what looks like daisy from mario which is a map of the world with famous cheeses like linked to their countries this was very offensive to sarah im just gonna add it in with like pen youre gonna vandalize the cheese theme park but dont worry we would never harm the cheese park so after inspecting that floor we went to check out upstairs oh wow look at the view which ended up being like a lookout deck from which you could see the entire park giant cheese checkpoint hey no its again its like a watchtower it was actually quite nice up here because not only did we get to hang out in the cheese i mean the cheese i am one with the cheese but we also got to get a birdseye view of all of the different buildings we had visited far over there is the trick eye museum and then further it be like maturing cheese room that was like one of the experience rooms and then theres the cheese palace cheese palace and then that is i guess imsil proper so thats whats in this giant pacman after our trip up the watchtower it was almost closing time for the cheese park all right i think everythings closing up right about now yeah i think its time for us to head back to the station and catch our train back our fourhour train back hat i hope i have eaten enough cheese to sustain me through that four hour trip yeah and though we hadnt seen every single thing what is that building that i dont think well ever know we had actually hit most of it including the gift shop on the way out you got ice cream and a gatorade okay its fine i just i didnt know where you were sorry i  i almost made us miss the train tran huh and with that we bid the imsil cheese theme park alveta saying goodnight and headed back to the train station whoa the wind in my hair i feel so alive all right we are you can see my receding hairline mine too be honest all right so we are done at the cheese theme park and we are heading back to seoul now on the train do we have cheese for the train too much cheese coma and because it was a sunday and apparently many people vacation for the weekend in the countryside the train going back into seoul was packed so none of us got to sit together but eventually four hours later our stop was called it was great for like two hours so we exited the train all a bit groggy and shockingly hungry so we stopped at a cafe nearby for a late dinner where sara thought it would be fun to employ our intial cheese straight into the dish man oh its melting in and though it was perhaps a bold move for our intestines to add even more cheese into our systems i thought the dish was pretty tasty and sara agreed and with that i think it was finally time for us to head back to our hotel and call it a day all right so cheesy okay so that was our trip to imsil south korea i think the cheese park definitely exceeded my expectations in a couple of areas though it wasnt quite six flags there were a fair amount of different attractions and the grounds were pretty expansive i also didnt know that much about the history of the imsil area and i think its actually quite cool that cheese is like so much their thing who says that thats actually what they say an imsil yeah thats imsils town motto now that said its definitely far and once again its mostly geared towards children there is like that one back area that seems to be more for parents but the rest of the park is more like a playground regardless i had a lot of fun at the cheese park and though we did get to taste a fair amount of cheese which i was excited about i think my favorite part was actually the scenery not only was it cool to see a lot of the korean countryside from the train the cheese park itself is actually really pretty with some seriously tranquil pastoral views im not sure if we will be returning to the cheese park mostly because we live a our plane ride away but if you live nearby its definitely a fun place to check out i will warn you in advance though if youre gonna ride the slide bring some fulllength pants my colons still rattling thank you guys so much for watching and once again a big thank you to sara for helping us get to the cheese theme park if you liked that video make sure to smash that like button and if you want to see more videos like this make sure to shamash that subscribe button here are my social media handles and a big shoutout to sophie for watching thanks for watching sophie and i will see you guys next time  hello friends and welcome to another video this week im gonna be getting a japanese lolita makeover in tokyo thats right you might just see me in some pink so last year on our japan trip i got a tokyo makeover where we explored some of the current street fashion trends seen in the harajuku neighborhood which is pretty much the fashion epicenter of the city with many clothing boutiques highend department stores and street photographers ready to snap shots of any fashionable people walking by including this guy whos rocking it now the harajuku area is also strongly associated with some of the most wellknown and frequently talked about japanese fashion subcultures including lolita which to put it shortly is a very poufy and frilly style inspired by vintage fashions from victorian england and rococo france and though it is very different from what i usually wear insert reference photo of a bat here i am very interested in trying it out because besides being a very striking style it has also become an increasingly worldwide phenomenon with lolita tea parties and harajuku fashion walks held all around the globe so this year while were in japan were gonna be doing a fullon deep dive into lolita style and its community and to do so were gonna be joined by our friend and guide of rinrin doll who is a tokyobased youtuber as was a working lolita model and enthusiast and together we will hopefully be able to come up with a headtotoe lolita look alright so lets go and get lolitafied so our first step once we got to japan was to meet up with rinrin who arrived at our hotel in the full lolita regalia hello everyone my name is rinrin and ive been doing lolita modelling for about  years now thank you so much for coming rinrin to our hotel room thanks for inviting me oh i made it weird i made it weird sorry and before going shopping for our outfit i wanted to figure out more of what lolita is all about now lolita fashion as we know it today has been around since the  inspired by a variety of earlier japanese fashion trends and visual krock bands and also notably bears no relationship to the  novel of the same name as we mentioned before lolita draws heavily from victorian and rococo aesthetics with the style goal being to blend feminine sophisticated almost aristocratic looks with whimsical fantasy elements and a dash of cute so theres a lot of lace corsets ruffles and too overthetop accessories with a couple of notable style inspirations being marie antoinette and alice from alice in wonderland and rinrin one of the biggest defining qualities of the lolita look is the overall shape basically this sort of cupcake silhouette a lot of fluff on the bottom so petticoats and crinoline are pretty essential cupcake silhouette keep that in mind but contrary to what my first impression of lolita was pastel colors are actually not that essential as there are many subgenres of lolita fashion that includes some of the same characteristics but have very different moods so you couldnt go from anything from goth to punk to the sweet style which is what im wearing or a pop style theres so many styles so while i was kind of expecting i would end up with something like what rinrin was wearing it turns out that there are a lot of other options so i could wear an allblack outfit and still be in lolita yes thats intriguing now one of the most common questions that people ask about lolita is why do people dress like this and a lot of lolita seem to say the same thing and its quite a simple answer it makes them happy its fun for them and they like to express themselves with their fashion rinrin said that when she put on her first lolita outfit and looked in the mirror i just got this clipped this is how i would like to see myself its very nice to love what youre wearing and how youre feeling at the same time and they often mention that part of the appeal is that theyre not dressing for other peoples approval its definitely your clothes for yourself i dont think its very like sexy its not to catch a mate i like that mmhmm youre just having fun wearing what you want to wear yeah now that sounded pretty familiar to me yeah your lolita is tylers gym shorts ah he did not wear them to attract a mate oh you found one despite it obviously theres more time and effort that goes into a full lolita outfit then tylers  year old a pair of gym shorts but i think the idea of dressing in something that makes you feel good definitely resonates with me reinsert photo of bat here so with those guidelines sort of stylistically and emotionally set it was about time for us to start building our outfit and our quest started in harajuku at the la fleur a department store whose lowest floor be  is almost entirely dedicated to subculture brands you cant go wrong on that floor so id like to take you around there and ive selected a couple shops that have a wide variety so now you can try out different styles awesome we had actually arranged to go to la for a before it opened so we arrived around 8 am in the pouring rain ready to get our shop on our plan was to visit three stores and try on two options at each one and first up was a via tosh okay so we are here at abia tosh with na ho who is one of the shop staff so this shop focuses on corsets and they would like people to be closer to it and wear it in their everyday fashion naho also mentioned that in addition to selling corsets they also specialize in antique style clothing and accessories so what kind of stuff were gonna be trying on right now so she says shed like you to try on a sort of gothic looking style and then a little bit more lightcolored style and the gothic look was up first and two beside some roughly black items we also needed a corset of course and once we had selected that it was time to try it all on would you need help um ill call okay if i need it ill just youll hear me yelping all right groaning perhaps alright lets do it unfortunately we werent able to do a dramatic curtain reveal of our outfit because i needed some serious handson assistance to get strapped in suck it in do your worst and from the impression i got from my rib cage oh yeah i would say not likes her laces typed how is it are you okay kiddo great but once i was in i did think the corset tied the whole look together all right so this is like look number one i very much enjoy it i am very tucked in yes i am cinched now who is not messing around were just were in it i also do like this kind of like rump look weve got going on here its sort of oh excuse me its sort of um rokoko why dontyoure is a bootylicious oh no its kind of like poofy licious yeah its not not delicious right in addition to the pouf to boot we also added a bonus choker corset as well as a slightly askew mini flowered hat oh wow i sort of feel like a fashionable one whos the lady from sweeney todd mrs lovett i kind of feel like a fashionable mrs lovett like i could be in cahoots with a murderous barber definitely to round out the look we added a few pieces of jewelry including this finger thingy that is something that like a marvel villain would wear yes its kind of like the infinity single ring its like the infinity index finger as well as this almost very like ear cuff im getting kind of a lord of the rings vibe you just went a little our way yeah i think with that they were finally pleased with the amount of things i was wearing very thick you like it all sticky and i was also generally pleased i mean i definitely feel a little short of breath but i also feel good in it so its hard to say so that was option number one now for our second outfit now help put me in a lighter corseted look to give us our first taste of some pastel alright so this is option number two from a via tosh now this isnt necessarily a traditional lolita silhouette but it does have some victorian vibes especially with the sort of night to gown need duster coat that i could grab and be outraged with like i almost feel like i need like a sheas lounge to like faint upon like scandalized how dare you excuse you so i would say that it was more of a victorian pajama look one thing i will say is that my cleavage is definitely making an appearance magical appearance i think now ho has created it with her masterful corset skills yes she said you you have it already oh thanks it was just hiding somewhere much further down now most lolita looks actually have quite high necklines and dont really feature cleavage however since i usually dont have much i wasnt mad but though i enjoyed this outfit i am a big fan of of like an outer layer i think that this was more of an alternative lolita look so i wasnt sure that this was the one for us and though we still had the first outfit as one of our possibilities it was time to continue on to store number two okay so now we are here at atelier pierrot which is actually just like a few sort of steps down from where we just were and we are here with my who is one of the shop staff today know atelier pierrot is a select shop that carries gothic and lolita items and when people mention alice in wonderland as a style icon i think you really get a sense of that here with like serious cupcake and mad hatter vibes so lets get started hey where should we begin yeah key guy in my show you know i thought the i she was my pretty much immediately grabbed the dress she wanted off the opposite rack which was a long layered dusty lavender gown so its a little bit summery because if the sleeves are shorter also feels a sort of breathable material i like that so at this one first okay perfect so i was quickly whisked away to the dressing room with my stockings following close behind we have tights for you oh great thank you now one thing to note is that although i usually do okay getting into japanese sized clothes my feet are a different story so i brought a few of my own shoe options from home and during rin and my unanimously chose the six inch platform ones which is fine but they do also make me a giant so just everyone be prepared all right i can walk im good im good super cute yeah though at least i was a supposedly cute giant i like this a lot actually its quite comfortable i like this sort of like easy almost like baby doll silhouette like the stockings a lot  the stockings are super cool theyre kind of like haunted mansion ii next up rinrin outfitted me with some wrist cuffs now were matching why do these make me feel like a cat i guess feel like ive paused now and then i squatted down so they could add a lacey necklace this is a thigh workout oh yeah and a mask for your head over my head its just you know im just leaving the masquerade so its just sort of askew i thought this outfit was really cool and i did feel kind of like an elegant basketball player sized porcelain doll come to life which i think is part of how youre supposed to feel with lolita like a little vintage and a little fantastical but my and rinrin had further plans for me and quickly handed me their pick for our second option all right here we go once more into the breech which was made up of a black blouse and a blue pinafore over dress oh this is cool i love this one i feel kind of like a pirate yeah like a sort of like gothic lolita pirate okay i feel like i could get into that i guess this is more of an elizabeth swann than an alice in wonderland but there were definitely some fantasy elements at play our our oh and youd like that single index finger ring from abbey atach id be like our yeah exactly very good its all coming together but before i could start plundering my and rinrin moved in with the accessories you got any booty for me and aleut any puffed snacks riven gooey goo sofia an eyepatch i thought tonight is she getting an ipad yeah i still cant believe they had an actual eye patch to try on its a lolita eyepatch oh my god its happening but after the elven ears and infinity index fingers i guess i shouldnt have been all that surprised is this a look yeah yeah is it is it a good look as if you look unfortunately for me i dont think it was the look is it gone super kawaii to like that kawaii i preferred no eyepatch yeah i think thats why to call but  the eyepatch though i really did like this look i think this really suits you hmm i like the color on it do you guys like this better than the purple dress i do so i think that this outfit might have been moving into the frontrunner position for us but we still did have one final store left to visit okay yeah so we are here at angelic pretty with aya and lime who are two of the shop staff are gonna be helping us out today now angelic pretty is the brand that rinrin has been working with for a long time and theyre well known for these sweet lolita outfits that they sell and two iya lime and rinrin the stores motto is for the little boys and girls inside of us who dream of being princesses which i think is a pretty different vibe for me when i was a little girl i wanted to be snowwhite whos got the blue and the yellow but now im more of a boy i said it great well the store looks awesome its very pink but im im willing im open and ready and willing so lets do it so we started searching for a couple of sweet lolita options sort of literally i love the food on this one popcorn cherry soda and marshmallows i could get down with that all right so why dont we try on this one then this guy is wearing a similar one  oh yeah you have the same one on popcorn marshmallow strawberry milk its making so they gave me a blouse to put under my pinafore and descent me to the dressing room farewell but this giant curtain tie and i gotta say it was kind of poetic i went into a giant curtain of pink and i came out as a giant curtain of pink wow this is me as always of course rinrin had many accessories for me including some that were food themed as well as surprisingly some shoes it fits my foot is it its a christmas miracle yeah and we finished off the outfit with a hair ribbon and a purse how do you feel i feel a little warm but overall i feel like im in the right zone like i feel like ive got the right elements going ive got the blouse ive got the pinafore ive got something in my hair the bag cool socks so i feel like im like suited up and i once again love my little wrist cuffs in fact i was very impressed by the wide variety of wrist cuffs that angelic pretty had to offer oh those are awesome pretty awesome yeah oh dont look at my naked nails i wonder what better nails a nine so with one sweet lolita look test driven we had just enough time to try one more outfit as at that point la foret was starting to open wow i like this one you are poufy i like this one a lot im very goofy yes we added two petticoats dont petty right now im double payment wow hanky  now i quite liked the elegant fish pattern on this dress also rinrin and i i think have matching blouses yes they did i mean i then got basically nascar pit stopped into my accessories doublefisting mystic double wristing that sounds better yes which finished off our final outfit option i was very impressed by just how poofy i was i feel like a bell and i think that really brought together the classic lolita cupcake aesthetic that we had heard so much about i actually like this one on you a lot me too i think i actually prefer it to the food one even though i am still wanting food but now that we had tried it it was time to evaluate all of our possible options and decide on what we wanted to wear so lets do that so we had tried on a lot of different outfits but in the spirit of what we had mentioned before about finding something that i would like to wear that i believe expresses me through it while still being lolita we settled on our gothic pirates look from atelier pierrot now of course im not literally a pirate but i feel like in a fairytale scenario im more of a swashbuckler than a princess so we went with that one with a few small tweaks alright rinrin found via a new shirt and it has a batwing sleeve im gonna be a pirate bat with no eyepatch but a wing i ran a pirate pi bat what we also added a corset from abiah taaj what do you think i liked a lot yeah i like this one can you breathe great no as well as a few more pieces of jewelry i feel like im marrying you now alright so after a little bit of shopping i think we have the final outfit in these two very large almost acts yours is a mine is more of a sack im so excited im excited too so next up were gonna be doing a makeup and hair and completing the look so the next day we rounded up our outfit haul and headed over to the shinjuku area to shot degrom okay so we are here at shanta grom which is a hair salon that has a large lolita clientele because of the styles that they do with linda who is a hair stylist as well as a lolita herself and de linda was gonna be tackling my main and giving it an appropriate do and as for my makeup rinrin was actually going to be the one to scale the mountain that is my face what rinrin is today outfitted in a gothic when you call it a gothic lolita style pretty goth i think pretty gothic lolita style linda says yes linda says yes god yes just to kind of match my vibe so i popped on my outfit  the corset and stuffed my petticoat itself into a chair im just like kind of like fluffing out of it im kind of like bread and a can right now so i could get my makeup did no rinrins vision for the look was something dramatic and purple to complement my dark outfit now i think overall lolita makeup follows general japanese makeup trends but just more exaggerated there are some pretty extreme looks out there but i think the general rule is that you just dont want your face to get lost in your bonnet its just all about balance so first up rinrin used some purple and gold eyeshadow to give me a bit of a smoky eye let me see cute and she was pretty liberal with the dark shadow all around the socket we are going for that funky i look so the jleague works with it perfectly yes youll have natural natural bags natural gosh and she also added some red blush like really high up my cheeks to emphasize that pulled an all nighter vibe after that we popped on some long fake lashes this is my come hither look and finally added a dark blotted lip with a faint bit of gold at the center alright so what do you think were done oh wow this i see a lot right here i love it yes i look so different amazing it looks great you did a great job thank you yeah i love it hello and with our makeup look done our next step was the hair style so linda whats our plan for the hair today is that kind of like what rinrin has with the ribbons yeah oh so ill have my hair be corseted my waist be corseted and my ankles be corset it of course is it everywhere did now for this look linda basically started separating my hair into multiple braids and then lacing those braids together with ribbon so my scalp almost resembled a bodice oh interesting so youre like corseting my braids together yeah i get it now this is a current hair trend thats popular amongst loli does that linda does a lot i am terrible at shoelaces and tying my shoes and anything involving shoelaces so this is way out of my league now besides corset hair there are a couple of other staple lolita hair looks that you see a lot notably the he may or princess haircut which is basically like straight across bangs with two longer side locks that frame your face as well as wigs hats and general head pieces but i think in our case we were getting away with just doing a lot of ribbons and aside from those linda was also curling the bottom part of my hair that wasnt corseted im being doused in hairspray and i like it smells like apples and with that my hair was done oh wow oh look at the back of my head it was ridiculous im very disappointed that i didnt say that in person i dont even understand whats happening there but lindas skills are ridiculous how did you where does one end and the other begin see i told you i this is way out of my league so with my head fully dressed it was time to put on the rest of my outfit and im preparing myself mentally theyre preparing the corset im preparing my long you should hold on to something yall turn around i think i should have realized when linda was doing my hair that she really wasnt gonna take any prisoners with the corseting yeah no its great like i have a giant fake butt right now so i think thats like a late victorian style oh yeah well look it up when we get back to the us from there we added on our jewelry and des stepped into my very high heels to finish off the ensemble youre like an avatar thing blue oh wow i cant see my head but i love the outfit after getting a better view of the whole look i was actually feeling way more tim burton than james cameron right now because youre in like a hair salon it is kind of like time exactly alright one day you and i are gonna go into the murdering business together rinrin jumped in to explain exactly what we were proposing and what i will say is that linda seemed kind of down yeah yes yes i knew there was a reason we got along so having been fully lolita fied we bid linda adieu and ventured out into the world or more specifically back to harajuku all right so this is my final lolita look i think we ended up with a really cool goth lolita bat pirate look rens giving me a thumbs up i was like will you validate me she says yes and in addition to our corseted pirate base our look also included the allimportant petticoat these patterned tights a garter with a bow that fell down a fair few times some black wrist cuffs one ring and two necklaces which we matched with our sunken eye makeup look our corseted hair and a pair of gray colored contacts i actually feel quite good in the outfit the corset is a little tight and the shoes our little intimidatingly tall but im feeling quite at home in the batwings and im also loving these wrist cuffs i just keep like squirreling around beyond feeling like this was a very personalized lolita look that i connected with i definitely had enough trappings of h century pirate to really get me into character sure definitely a phrase but though i was feeling the outfit like emotionally there were some physical elements to contend with look at these tiny steps youre making tough like trying really hard not to tip over a mountain goat and also not to trip over my own feet on the stairs haha victory is mine surprisingly though the corset wasnt really giving me that many problems im actually doing quite well in the course and im standing up straight give me a few more hours well see how i feel but right now im feeling pretty good now while we were in harajuku we wanted to take our own streets nap style photos of us in our gothic lolita looks but my shoes once more posed a challenge if i have like one foot up and one foot back then it kind of evened out right yeah is it the perfect place for you to take this photo together slightly on like a slope and once we had those under our belt or should i say on our phones it was time to move on to a common lolita activity afternoon tea now as rinrin mentioned in our interview afternoon tea is a pretty typical activity for the lolita community and it gives everyone a chance to dress up a little bit nicer and to go and have an enjoyable evening or lunch together that said it seems like its less about the actual tea and its more about showing off your proverbial sunday best outfit and hanging out it does very much fit the aesthetic i would like to take a lot of pictures yes afternoon tea set so with a team heres the twist you only talk about the beauty guru community its not supposed to be that kind of tea its supposed to be real tea and thats the team oh my god and chick talk has made its way into our video now rinrin had made us reservations at a place called cue pot cafe in oda wadda which is a very charming shop that has a lot of lolita complimentary backgrounds and seating areas oh did i mention this month this place has a community cat themed theres no actual cats here we thought his cat cafe for a second but as the part of the cat tea while we were deciding on what cat themed snacks we should get oh my god luck and so here we were presented with matching cat jewelry to wear during our tea party its quite the contrast of your other necklace yes yeah its sort of like emily dickinson and her cats thats darkness and very quickly our food and drink arrived pm funds off yes is tea time all you could ever hope for it is coffee and buy food i mean waves and waves of sweet snacks oh my wow thats a fun day you know homemaker you do this i had a really great time at our small tea party and i think rinrin was correct in that it just felt like the right place to be while all dressed up there are actually also other girls dressed in lolita apparently some combination of afternoon tea graham worthy treats aesthetic surroundings and cats brings all the lolitas to the yard look for cats but eventually after finishing our tea set posing at the surrounding booths and exploring the other floors of the cafe look theres a giant mushroom wow look at that it was time for us to say farewell to cue pot my soccer changing shoes up dont tell anyone and i think my shoes coming off kind of marked the beginning of the end of my first lolita experience okay so was it a successful lolita day reverend overall i really dug my time in our lolita outfit there are a lot of elements to this outfit and keeping track of all of the elements is definitely a task but i really enjoy it as a former theater kid myself i had a great time playing what i felt was like a very meticulous and extravagant round of dressup and my ribs are hurting a little and my feet are definitely hurting but my wrists are warm and comfortable so as for lolita style overall i definitely understand the appeal i mean the outfits and the accessories are awesome but beyond the actual clothing whats interesting to me is how lolita fashion brings people together because the emotion and enthusiasm behind the style becomes like a shared passion as rinrin says its like having friends in different countries you might have never met before but you have this already strong bond i love that its fashion plus community and to be honest the tea party was pretty tasty so i get why people like that  so when all is said and done i could see myself wearing this look again especially if rinrin comes to visit us or you know maybe if i wanted to dress up for a performance of the pirates of penzance lets wrap this up thank you guys so much for watching and once again a big thank you to rinrin and to everyone who made our lolita makeover possible if you liked that video make sure to smash that like button and if you want to see more videos like this make sure to chumash that subscribe button here are my social media handles and a big shout out to hoosier sarah for watching thanks for watching hoosier sarah and i will see you guys next time hello friends and welcome to another video this week were gonna be visiting some of the most unique vending machines in tokyo yes thats right were heading back to japan and were gonna be hitting up their vending machines hard now for some context there are a ton of vending machines in japan like they are everywhere and they mostly sell convenient items like hot and cold coffee and tea water and sports drinks for people to grab on the way to school or work or in our case to fend off jet lag apparently japan has the highest vending machine per capita rate with one machine for every  people which isnt really a stat i thought existed until right now but it makes sense because it almost feels like youre outnumbered when youre there and people have mentioned that these 5 million some vending machines can make up to 7 trillion yen per year which is about  billion dollars and i will say that on our japan trip last year we definitely partook in many of the vending machines stationed around tokyo especially because of how convenient they are if you have a pass mo or suica card for the subway you can just get whatever you want whenever you want however it was only after our trip that we discovered how many different kinds of vending machines there are like ones that sell hot foods like pizza fresh produce mystery electronics snails in a can theres even a vending machine restaurant with no people in it its just a room full of hot food vending machines so in light of all of that weve scouted out four interesting vending machines in tokyo to visit while were there all right to tokyo we go so obviously the first step to getting to our japanese vending machines was to fly to japan now in tokyo we stayed at a hotel in the shinjuku area which has like a giant train station that served as a hub for us to get all over the place in tokyo its a really big station i think you can take a train within the station to another part of the station and our vending machine adventure day was like our third day in japan so needless to say we were a little jetlagged but excited to explore all right so we are right now here in shinjuku park near our hotel and we are ready to set off on our vending machine excursion our first vending machine was one that we had seen written about online that contains a couple of interesting food items and is located in the kichijōji area kichijōji does that sound right i feel like this video is just gonna be full of me saying japanese locations pretty badly mediocrely yeah so just be prepared for that so lets do this i could probably use a coffee from like a normal vending machine yeah yeah lets hit one of those first multiple thats a win so we hopped on the subway heading west to get to our first vending machine now kichijōji is a semiresidential but very cool and desirable area thats a little outside the center of tokyo that besides having many shopping alleyways and boutique restaurants is also the home to some very scenic parks that house many interesting vending machines alright so we are here at inokashira park yes yes perfect nailed it yes with rinrin who is a japanese youtuber and lolita model who helped us out last year with our tokyo makeover and she is here to help us identify what unique things we shall be eating from these vending machines and maybe eating a couple herself i dont know i wont put pressure but maybe maybe she wants to try one or two yeah now there are a lot of vending machines in this park but one thats caught my attention in particular is this one that has canned bread in it i mean once i heard of canned bread i was like i need it i need it that baby needs it too we all need it now canned bread is something that i didnt think actually existed outside of spongebob like its in that one episode where squidward goes to the grocery store and is like amazed to find it so when i heard about the opportunity to eat canned bread irl i had to go for it and inside that same machine theres also grasshopper and hornet larvae hornet larvae now to clarify the hornet larvae are for eating not for like growing into your own colony of hornets but besides seeming like a sort of interesting snack i was very intrigued by the idea that this vending machine like paired these two things together so up first we purchased our bread okay so it says pan can because pan is bread in japanese and can is you know can oh so its very simple okay and then this one it has a little dad joke down here this is  caramel panda no panda and this a pun cuz of bread and panda panda so we decided to get the strawberry flavored bread for  yen or about five bucks oh its light actually it sounded so heavy but it feels so light i like that it says for emergency snack on the bottom right and then we had to purchase the insects now we decided to go for the hornet larva over the grasshoppers i think besides sounding more unusual the hornet larva were also more expensive so those were the ones i wanted what can i say i have expensive taste this way right no the other way the other way yeah im nailing this you guys oh im so glad its in stock now i didnt know this beforehand but as rinrin read like on the signs on the machine apparently people eat hornet larva for its like nutritional benefits for morning energy or noon energy or night energy  hours wow so like a our energy it sounds like something chris traeger would eat i know i agree the store next door actually offered toothpicks to spear the larva so we grabbed a couple and then found a place in the park to sit down and try our goodies alright so shall we start with the bread in a can or the hornet larva bread please smells really good oh it smells great actually oh look at it i mean it is just kind of canshaped bread was it air sealed yeah its our casper mattress i almost expected it to like expand once i took it out of the wrapper but it stayed the same cylindrical shape its like the leaning tower of pan in a can it was quite squishy though its kind of fluffy actually and it was kind of like laced with like a strawberry marbling throughout oh did it just split in half yeah it felt like a croissant it does kind of look like a croissant theyre sort of like air holes in there you know i mean its a cronut guys oh this is what everyones been waiting for so after a lot of leadup all right cheers cheers it was time for us to actually eat the bread mmhmm i really like it its jam it tastes different in here it kind of tastes like fruity pebbles really it has the texture of a croissant but the flavor of a fruity pebble i like it and i wasnt the only one who liked it the pigeons are in route guys they want this yeah i mean listen this is like their jam literally it was like almost a pun it was like close to a pun i think i just said the word jam tyler also tried the bread oh hell yeah squidward was right yeah this is amazing it definitely tasted good but it was really more of a strudel in a can or like a danish in a can versus like the plain bread in a can that i imagine the squidwardian version to be but this is probably more of a desirable product no this makes sense as a snack actually yeah and it makes sense to be in a park yeah like you could just take this on a picnic so after the bread it was time to taste the hornet larvae i think ive slowly roped rinrin into trying the hornet larva shes holding a toothpick so she cant turn back now oh  those groans that youre hearing is rinrin being skeptical subtitle rinrin groaning now i wasnt exactly expecting the larva to be quite so soggy but when i sniffed them they smelled okay actually it kind of doesnt smell that bad it kind of smells like a sort of like a soy sauce like a saltiness yeah which rinrin confirmed when she read the ingredients there is soy sauce oh there is the hornet larva some sugar and soy sauce thats it so there was some stuff in there to soften the blow thats a juicy one look at that cheers  rinrin did you just fake out eating it rinrins betrayal aside my first reaction was that it was honestly not all that bad what ill say is i cant tell its a bug it actually does taste a lot like the fermented soybean kind of thing it kind of feels like that where its kind of like a chewy bean rinrin and i had been talking earlier about how it kind of smelled like nattō which is a slightly slimy fermented soybean dish and it kind of tasted like that too i see do you want it rinrin im just so scared because im allergic to bees oh yeah rinrin you didnt tell us i forgot so tyler ate it in her stead oh its good and weirdly he was into it i like that i want to get the big guy all right so tyler found like a straightup fullon hornet in there thats not a larva thats just a hornet mama little crunchier thats like really good and apparently he liked that too its good dude its like right up there with the bread its like jerky almost its good i dont know how to react to you right now because i i agree with you that its like not that bad but i wouldnt call it good i feel like he was either hamming it up for the camera or maybe we were like feeling the energizing effects of the larva a little bit theyre like wiggling more yeah so larvae doing great but at that point we had only really eaten a couple of larvae each so that seemed unlikely okay so that was vending machine stop number one rinrins still holding everything so we plopped back on the train and headed over to unusual vending machine number two in harajuku now the harajuku area is like a fashionable shopping district with many stores boutiques and kind of instagram cute food locations however this vending machine has nothing to do with any of that it is a super spicy vending machine but not like flaming hot cheetos or taki spicy like carolina reaper or ghost pepper magnitude spice which definitely seems entertaining but doesnt seem very profitable or desirable as a vending machine product so is this where we start our mini hot ones interview basically now the machine itself is very eyecatching because there are a lot of flames and skulls on it as well as disclaimers and instructions of what not to do with spicy stuff  something spicy was collected how to feel the pain is each person please never use it in play dont take this one to a love hotel  now there were so many pictures of peppers on the machine that i kind of thought that they might be selling like carolina reapers in a bag but it turned out that they were like rice crackers in super super spicy sauce but it seems like a traditional japanese like snack but turned into really spicy after looking at our options for a while we decided to go with the scorpion ones it says call the pain of the scorpion extremely spicy its also a little bit more expensive so i dont know maybe its fancier and this snack had a trinidadian scorpion pepper sauce on it which is apparently like the second spiciest pepper in the world and it kind of ominously came in a few protective layers for a second i thought it was one of those things it like you like have a clerk open for you one thing i would like to note is that this machine was selling the same cat purses that the larva vending machine in inokashira park was i dont know whats going on with the coin purses theyre just like part of the whole like canned bread hornet larva spicy snack rotation they just naturally go together thats what it is but regardless we had to get a cat purse so i bought this disgruntled looking black cat surrogate crusty for the trip yeah so with our haul in hand we settled in and braced ourselves for the spice alright so rinrin tapped out which is definitely fair it smells pretty spicy from the sign we know that this is at least a million scovilles of heat and to put that in perspective something like tabasco sauce is supposed to be about  scovilles and tabasco is not not spicy so this thing is crazy the scoville thing is like really exponential scoville is the hypebeast of measurements is what i would say we did have some water nearby and tyler also had his own like escape route planned theres an icecream place right there thats the place we went to last year at the end of our tokyo fashion makeover video so im just gonna get that and without further ado we gave it a chomp it did hurt my mouth and make me like salivate a lot first bite tasty a few seconds later a little painful i mean the crunch but i feel like tyler was quite visibly affected  we had brought our remaining bread in a can to use as a chaser which actually came in handy you want the pancan can me im surprised im still talking how are you doing ty hiccuping oh youre hiccuping oh yeah if you hiccup then you know its spicy are you having a meltdown tyler is having a meltdown what a fun passing snack did you eat all of the pancan its okay you can have it hes off hes worse off than i am should i have a second one go for it so after trying it i would say that this is more of a spicy challenge than a real food i dont think i could eat a whole bag of them even though i like them which makes it kind of a weird choice for a vending machine because i feel like you might want to try it once but probably not do it again maybe thats why they have the cat purses alright imma go get some ice cream okay i guess i was vending machine number two it destroyed tyler but im still standing  now having seen what happened to tyler rinrin wanted to take a go herself r well itadakimasu  swhich was bold especially since she opted to lick it which i feel like is the worst way to go its like having a hole through my tongue its like i pierced it its gone i feel like this makes me look pretty badass so im liking this im liking everyone else and with our taste testing spice quelling and i guess my peacocking done we grabbed yet another vending machine coffee im gonna drink like five of these today i love crafts boss crafts boss is boss and headed over to vending machine number 3 or should i say vending machines plural since we were really going to what has been described as a creepy vending machine corner i am not calling it that people call it that t they do call it that s other people call it a creepy vending machine cluster so i figured we had to go check it out ourselves so we took the subway east to akihabara which is what i would describe as a busy neighborhood that is known for being a center for anime gaming and tech culture it also has a lot of themed cafes like maid cafes as well as a ton of gachapon or capsule machines that sell little collectibles its a capsule machine selling mini capsule machines alright now we just need to find a vending machine selling mini vending machines the creepy corner is a short walk from the station like over a bridge and down a residential street so we found it pretty quickly and took a little peek inside rinrins freaked out a little bit i am we kind of just stepped inside a bit and i already got the creepy feeling up my legs the corner itself is under a dilapidated looking apartment building or house and i think it objectively looks a little haunted and that i think is why people think this is creepy to be fair we did come at like the exact right time of day to be freaked out cause its like  pm and the sun is setting so its like whats going on here but the vending machines themselves do also look a little dusty like maybe theyve been abandoned i mean looking at how rundown this particular one is is doing it for me and they do sell what seems to be a purposefully odd set of items like plastic bugs plastic figurines chargers some bells the bells are almost the weirdest ones like dont ring those bells there are also a lot of notes and signs that seem like theyve been left behind for you to discover rinrin started reading one that was inside the vending machine hold on hold on  what what whats happening no it says something really gross i dont even know if you want this in your thing the sign apparently says  that you can enjoy these bath salts for  yen but they would not recommend sticking them up your girlfriends butt is that a concern what are they like pop rock bath salts like what alright i feel like the creepy vibe is now dissipated for some reason theyre just trying to mess with us if these are ghosts theyre just horny ghosts its fine now besides the pop rock booty salts and the other random items one of the other things that this corner is known for are like mystery box vending machines that have notes on each box there is like a little description on each one mmm is it dirty too yep dont put it in your butt talking about i dont want to be quoted saying this kind of stuff like i dont want to be quoted for that butt thing either so besides that first one nook of vending machines we also discovered a few more inlets facing the street around the corner theres even more back here which seemed to be filled with more just random items whats this sign say rinrin well it has a warning well hell no im coming out hold on it says please dont leave your cardboard boxes here there are actual people living here and theres a sleeping baby alright im okay even though the evidence was piling up that this corner wasnt actually that creepy alright theres another popcorn machine back here there are a fair amount of cardboard boxes to be fair the design of the place was just kind of rundown and like a little funhousey why do i feel like im gonna bout to get jumpscared its hard to tell like where the alleyways go and once youre inside them theyre very claustrophobic and you can kind of see between the machines so you unexpectedly catch glimpses of people walking through the other passageways hey i was just like looking at rinrin i thought it was a mirror or something hey rinrin hello uh almost so after taking a look at our options of what we could actually buy though there were some interesting items i was most intrigued by the mystery boxes because well theyre a mystery now rinrin has told us that most of the like little notes that are written on these boxes are pretty inappropriate weve found one that seems to be decently youtube friendly i think its about a comedian owing money and then running away why am i kind of nervous and when i pulled it out there was another note on the side this feels like escape the night heres the note is it the same thing the note actually said happy reiwa era which is the new imperial era of japan that just started pretty recently so if nothing else this mystery box could only have been in there for a couple of months there are some words on the inside its a choco bat it looks like chocolate sticks like thick pocky which i would say is a pretty normal item given all the suspense it tastes a little stale but its good i think of all the things we could have gotten thats pretty safe mmhmm chocolate on your teeth oh im sure there was however another note on the inside of the wrapping its an address that was a little strange were not going to the address were not going to the address in atami its so far away its not even tokyo were gonna keep the bats and were gonna were gonna keep it at that so in addition to our choco bats tyler had been just generally interested in hot food vending machines and there happened to be a hot popcorn machine like right there so we bought a bag for  yen oh its on and it basically just takes a bag of unpopped kernels puts them into an internal microwave for about a minute or two and then serves them to you oh yep there it is ready oh its freakin hot okay theres no way of telling like how long the kernels have been in there unpopped but they tasted pretty good oh thats great want some popcorn alright this is a great thing to do  with a vending machine hmm its really good overall my final take is that the whole creepy thing seems to be sort of like a publicity stunt to get people to come to the vending machines and you can tell after reading a lot of the signs and notes that its all meant to be like a big practical joke this house it is mess everything thats definitely whats happening its just a prank its just a prank bro bra rough though i think it is a fair warning to not put bath salts up your butt alright so that was the creepy corner yeah it is obviously nighttime right now but i do have one final vending machine that i wanted to visit that is nearby it is hot ramen in a can so i was thinking we could go and get some dinner exactly so i had seen this hot ramen in a can in another japanese vending machine video and it seemed like a pretty solid thing to get after a day filled with exciting things but not really things that you want to eat a lot of so i thought it would be a fun quick thing to grab and try out to finish out the video boy was i wrong are we lost maybe so we had been working off of this video in particular to locate the machine which told us that it was somewhere in akihabara but not exactly where however in the background of this shot you can see the k bookstore on the opposite corner so i figured if we went to the k books in akihabara we would find it but when we got there there was no ramen in sight it was then that i realized that this video was from  which i kind of forgot was a long time ago so probably either the k books or the vending machine had moved in the you know like six years since then still determined to find some soup we started just searching online for any clues okay weve been looking for the hot ramen for a hot second i think we might have found a lead my original lead may not have been a lead at all were gonna find it besides that we also tried asking one of the maids who was advertising her maid cafe on the street for pointers while tyler just started running around the streets by himself the maid told us that she had never heard of a hot ramen machine but there was a hot oden in a can machine nearby that she knew of which is another type of japanese soup at that same moment hello tyler called me oh you found it and told me that he had found a hot oden machine a few blocks away man he must have moved fast where did he go hes he left there he is oh look hes running how did you find it i ran around the block i found it this is such a wild quest for ramen in a can theyve all been pretty easy to find until this point tyler suspects that this is the same corner that we saw in the original video oh is this it and its really just that the k books has moved to a new location and theyve gotten rid of the ramen from the machine and i think he might be right so turning our attention back to the soup which one should we get they had either a fish ball or a beef tendon oden and we chose the beef oh yeah its hot oh its hot ooo my fingers oden is known for having a lot of different veggies and items in it notably daikon which is like a type of radish its not really like ramen but at that point i was down for anything surprise its larvae oh no oh smells good these hot soup cans usually have a toothpick inside with which you eat all of the solid bits sorry i render and ive stuck my finger in it now i think its this that youre supposed to yep there you go but our toothpicks seem to have something already on it this is konjac so i ate that first so how does it be good for you oh its good for me it tastes good for you it tastes good for me got it besides that i think youre just supposed to drink the broth oh thats actually really good broth is awesome which makes it hard to share with multiple people oh i bit into the too thick so rinrin sat this one out we were missing some spoons i think a little bit just a little bit i was surprised by the amount of stuff that was in there good like things just kept coming out that one was good i ate a fair amount of my own hair which was mediocre but the radish was good and they were generally pretty solid including this egg which we found about ten minutes into eating the soup overall i would say that this soup was pretty good and it feels hearty im into it and as a vending machine product it makes sense if you want like a hot dinner on the go but for us im not sure it was worth all of the time we spent running around looking for it though i am amazed that in the end we found any hot soup in a can at all so i guess im not in a position to complain but with that we had visited all of our unique japanese vending machines as well as one more normal coffee one today overall i thought that all of the machines were pretty fun and left quite an impression im not sure we fully answered the question of why they all exist except for maybe just as a side hustle for selling cat purses but i think they all employ some version of the be kind of out there for press purposes tactic so even though they may not actually sell items that are desirable for everyday use  minus maybe the odin they do attract new customers through articles videos or just word of mouth so theres sort of like low maintenance versions of instafamous foodsattractions personally my favorite part of the day besides the larva of course was just getting to see different parts of the city we did spend a lot of time on the train and i think next time were in japan well definitely be visiting some more unique vending machines but maybe not spicy ones for tylers sake thank you guys so much for watching and once again a big thank you to rinrin for helping us explore these vending machines if you like that video make sure to smash that like button and if you want to see more videos like this make sure to shamash that subscribe button here are my social media handles and a big shout out to audrey for watching thanks for watching audrey and i will see you guys next time  hello friends and welcome to another video today im gonna be melting one of every lipstick from the drugstore together into one giant mega drug i mean mega lipstick so ive previously mixed together a lot of things including my own makeup as well as every candle from bath and body works every beauty gurus eyeshadow palette and about a year ago one of every lipstick from sephora with the goal of that experiment being to find the average or midpoint shade of all of the lipsticks sold there which would be an approximate representation of the most marketable lipstick at sephora and that frankenphora lipstick ended up being this berry color which i think turned out this way because of just how many pink lipsticks sephora stocks what can i say sephora likes pink so what we want to do with this franken lipstick experiment is to compare the midpoint shade of the drugstore lipsticks to the midpoint shade of the lipsticks at sephora to not only see the full array and statistics of what the drug store offers color wise but also how the brands and the price point may affect what the drugstore thinks are their most marketable shades so our plan is to gopro up walk into the drugstore buy a ton of lipsticks and then get to melting but first a couple of things one per our previous experiment when i melt down all of these lipsticks im gonna end up with more than just one tube of lipstick so im going to take the extra tubes that i make and give them back to you guys as a subscriber giveaway we are probably not gonna do a naming contest this time because that got wildly out of hand but we will share all of the details for the giveaway at the end of the video two also per our previous video this video is sponsored but this time by honey now if you dont know honey is a free browser plugin that automatically checks for the best promo

want to try it out you can download it for free at joinhoneycomsafiya alright and with that its time for frankenlipstick 2 electric boogaloo so step one of our drugstore frankenlipstick adventure was to choose which drug store we would ransack now product availability does vary from drugstore to drugstore but i would say there are a few main makeup brands that we all think of when we think of drugstore makeup that i want to make sure we hit so i wanted to find a sort of typical drugstore location aka not one of those walgreens that have like a really soupedup beauty section and i also wanted to make sure that i was shopping at an actual drugstore and not just a larger store that happens to sell drugstore brands like target or ulta so i chose good ol cvs now i am admittedly partial to cvs because one sprang up near my childhood home when i was in about eighth grade so a large part of my high school makeup experimentation was facilitated by them i am also just generally an extrabucks ho ok so we are outside of cvs right now ready to head in and attempt to buy one of every lipstick that they sell in there i am nervous im always nervous when we go and like film in a store that they could kick us out of but im a little excited to you know get my hands on some lipsticks just grab them grab and go well grab pay and go  but mostly grab and go so for our frankencvs lipstick experiment just so we arent mixing too many elements im gonna make sure that every product we buy is a traditional lipstick not a liquid lipstick lip pencil crayon or balm  i know  but were not doing anything bad were just buying a lot of their stock its mischievous but its not illegal however i will include any finish like sheer matte metallic and cream just so we can get a range of formulas as well as colors  thats the viking in me there is also the dynamic of what if a lipstick is sold out and im sure that we may just miss a few completely oh my god im gonna get so many extrabucks this is gonna be out of control but if i notice that a lot of colors are missing from a particular brand or line ill make sure to fill in as many of the blanks as i can by going to another cvs exhausted exhale  that took a while  whats interesting is that actually picking the lipsticks off the shelves didnt take that long but checking out took like an hour and not because of all the scanning we literally had to call chase bank like eight times to tell them that we were not fraudulent but with five bags of lipsticks i think we got it i am like very impressed by the amount of receipts that we have to be honest  and also the length of them um maypole who yproject who look im meghan markle  alright so after some bank issues and some aid from some helpful cvs employees i think we have all the lipsticks that this cvs has to offer so lets get out of here before they change their minds come on lets go okay so we are here with all of our lipsticks ready to chop so after our trip to cvs we collected over  different lipsticks which we have since sorted into different color categories and also swatched i think something we learned from last time is that preswatching is best just so someone doesnt forget to swatch  past safiya what happened past tyler i think i forgot to swatch the last two and the color categories we have are nudes pinks reds purples browns oranges and miscellaneous odd ones and like last time im going to begin with the nudes okay so lets just dive right into it shall we im gonna start with this guy it is a loreal color riche mattitude now in addition to the general megacvs lipstick im also throwing in an element to our experiment that we didnt do in our sephora video which is making individual frankenlipsticks for each of our color categories so were gonna be making an average nude lipstick an average red lipstick an average purple lipstick etc just because im interested to see how those would turn out so before i drop each of our lipsticks into our mixing bowl im going to be chopping off just the tip of it to go towards its respective subcategory lipstick and once ive chopped the heads off of each of them im just gonna chop the bodies into the large pan so as we detailed in our sephora video as well as our lipstick cake video there is a way to extract the entirety of the lipstick from the tube if youre able to kind of like grasp the front part and pull it out that doesnt always work though especially with softer lipsticks so ill try my best but we might just have to hack some of them off  its gonna be a hack job alright here we go another one bites the dust  im just getting into the zone auto zone  i dont know gasp that was that was horrible that was a wet one  no it was was a revlon but it was wet and it was wild these physician formula ones are like super buttery they are made with murumuru butter so i guess them being buttery makes sense but they are very annoying to swatch and cut because they kind of like just disintegrate in your hands  i dont even want to start there thatll get thats gonna drive me insane  heres the interesting thing about that is arent whales always nude they dont wear clothes   what  already i just i feel like its so early for that what do you want what do you want okay so we only have three nude lipsticks left well i guess technically 4 since the elf one is doublesided but were almost there  was that cool  is this what being cool feels like and after those were done with the nudes weve got a lot of lipstick in this pot i also have a lot of lipstick heads in here which are actually quite satisfying to look at they do look like chocolate chips except less edible unless youre me in which case who knows if ill eat it or not so next up its time for the pinks now there are a lot of lipsticks in the pink section and some of them are kind of like pinkynudes there was a lot of gray area or should i say taupe area so as a disclaimer ill say that these categories are subjective but we tried our best with the rosybeiges yeah this one looks nude its like terracotta i dont know colors i dont like any more terracotta berry and mauve very ambiguous colors cause mauve could be purple pink or nude so mauve can just go where the sun dont shine oh shiz  did you call me saft  theyre gonna be soft saft these burts bees are giving me burts balls i like keep thinking im about to get it and then it fails ive been noticing that even though im not having as much luck with like pulling the entire lipstick out with the knife ive been having some success pulling it out with my bare hands this makes you want this lipstick a lot more doesnt it the hands dont always work though sometimes i just sort of grasp at it for a while and nothing happens so on that note this is our final pink lipstick and next up were onto the reds now unlike the pinks i feel pretty confident that most of these reds are in fact red so yay for that however as we saw with the sephora lipsticks the red ones are usually even softer than the pink ones so even though they look good now its just gonna turn murdery real fast cuz theyre not coming out without a fight  yeah not all reds obviously contain carmine which if you guys dont know is bugs but carmine is a like natural way to get a very red color so there could be some beetle juice in here some cleopatraapproved beetle juice i probably shouldnt say that a third time  thats not true burgundy is totally in the red category watch out ill fight you and i have two knives  im honing a useless skill that is most of my life right now oooooooo that was too much  sorry everyone maybe i should stop trying to back flip them so vigorously off my knife i may be getting a little overzealous alright so after another hour we are nearing the end of the red section that means like the only hurdle really we have left is the purples and then its smooth sailing to a bowl full of lipstick  and also bed  tyler this is gonna be full when i said full i meant full and with all those chopped its time to move on to the purples which is sort of a diverse category that includes some true purples but also some darker berries and some like mauveygreigey  colors now i dont think this is gonna be super obvious because were gonna be editing this footage heavily but we have been chopping for hours and its nearing 4 am and in the hopes of finishing this chopping session before the sun rises im just gonna forge right ahead through the purples im gonna part the purple sea that makes no sense at all  yeah i dont even know if im speaking words right now so this is our final purple let me just decapitate him real quick and then everyone cross your fingers for a clean exit  there we go will there be a flip oooooo not bad all right so that concludes the purple category so now all we have left are the browns the oranges and the miscellaneous i think we can make it before the sun rises am i making any sense why am i doing like airplane signals with my hands whats happening right now lets bring in the browns okay weve decided were not gonna talk about it anymore were just gonna chop  i mean theres no reason really it just seems sort of egregious to be doing this as the sun rises  i just want to say a big congratulations to tyler for making it this far through the night tyler is not as much of a night owl as i am  but you know its  and hes still here so everyone say yay tyler  i dont have any lines anymore im just here doing this seemingly forever whoo and that is the browns so im ready for our final two categories the oranges and the miscellaneous category which is mostly blues grays and whites these categories are pretty small so thats why i have these little baby containers for their heads so cute so small there is daylight creeping in you might notice that the frame will get slightly brighter over the next i dont know  to  minutes that it takes us to get through these lipsticks but you know its okay we had a good time we watched about a season and a half of the office and i chopped over  lipsticks so im feeling good okay time for the final lipstick  gasps  no  i dont know if i can backflip it oh nope it just flopped in it plopped it flopped it flopped alright so with that we are done detubing these damn lipsticks and its time for us to go to bed but i am very happy that we got all of our lipsticks chopped into our bowl and we have all of our little heads waiting to be melted into their mini category frankenlipsticks as well so yay for this step being done good nightslashgood morning and the next time you see me hopefully ill have slept and will be ready to melt alright so its the next evening and were here and mostly alive so in terms of the melting im gonna melt my big pot first and then well move on to the minifrankens so in a few of our previous melting videos weve used this hot plate to kind of like get things going and then weve gone in with the hairdryer and or other heating tools including blowtorch but i feel like that takes a while so im gonna turn the hot plate on but im not gonna wait for it to do anything im just gonna get in there now in preparation of using our heating tools im gonna suit up with my goggles and my gloves also i am secretly wearing the frankenphora lipstick just to celebrate the birth of a new megafrankenlipstick that ones not about safety though thats just for me and now the blowtorch be safe with blowtorches kids im gonna try and like kind of move it around a little bit so its not only on the orange  cause its melting pretty fast but its also smoking wait ty its really smoking woah okay wait hold on alright lets go in a little bit with the hairdryer just cause its a little less intense i dont want to like burn the pigment off its less instantaneous  but probably better for the lipsticks in the end ohh yeah  i like when it slides around oh here we go do you see it lipstick mountain is crumbling or maybe its slowly deflating i love the smell i kind of feel like im on a tropical vacation but just with like a big box of crayons next to me alright i think were approaching lipstick stew here whoaaaa whoaaaa its liquid all right i feel like we should mix it up a little bit just because i feel like there are some layers down there that i think are solid because i havent seen them yet oh yeah look at that theres a lot of stuff down there oh theres a sea of nudes under there its like nudelantis the lost nude civilization so lets hit these under layers with the hairdryer too and i think that just because there are a lot of chunks down there im gonna use the blow dryer and stir with the spatula at the same time and hopefully we can get them out of there that way so i think were pretty close to the final color of the frankencvs i think it is definitely in the same color family as the frankenphora but it might be a little less vibrant like perhaps a little bit more nude or like beige and it is also more sparkly tyler very sparkly safiya for sure after throwing my pot on the stove for a second its now completely liquid so im gonna mix like these sort of like last lipstick bits in there really quick there we go thats what i want to see and then im going to ladle out our melted lipstick into our molds and then well stick these guys in the freezer risky transfer risky transfer weird saf noises sorry i cant see anything so to make this frankencvs concoction we melted down  lipsticks from  different brands and within those  lipsticks we mixed together  nudes  pinks  reds  purples  browns  oranges and  miscellaneous lipsticks irrespective of color we also melted  matte lipsticks  metallic lipsticks and  cream or unspecified but i feel like the default is cream lipsticks and i feel like the fact that  of those lipsticks were metallic kind of accounts for the fact that our mixture is pretty shiny theres also some sort of like pigment fragments on top which to be honest im not sure like from whence they come my guesses are that theyre either just large molten glitter chunks or perhaps i like fried some of the pigments out just a little but either way im just gonna ignore them all right so our frankencvs is in the mold so what we do now is we put them in the freezer for like  to  minutes and then well take them out and tube them and see what they look like oh that looks good okay so im gonna scrape the excess wax off of the top here and then put it back into here just so we can like remelt it you know not lose any wax i think like real lipstick makers have like real versions of this bloop this is like some kind of like cake serving thing i think its actually like a rosanna pansino merch item yeah now in terms of how the color breakdowns compare between our cvs experiment and our previous one with sephora for both stores the big four categories  nudes pinks reds and purples  dominate across the board but cvss breakdown is more skewed towards pinks and away from purples while sephoras big four are pretty evenly represented so if i thought sephora liked pink cvs might need a restraining order all right let me grab a tube ready its tube time all right here we go boom and another frankenlipstick is born cackles this one looks great the funny thing is that despite the statistical differences in the color distribution this color looks pretty similar to the frankenphora color it is definitely the sister or sibling of the frankenphora but i am very excited to see how it differs because im pretty sure its not exactly the same in particular i do think that the color is a little redder and a little more muted i do have some theories for why it is similar though but ill reserve my final thoughts for when we swatch it im gonna hold off for a second though because we also have our minicategory frankenlipsticks to make so let me melt these down real quick okay so for our babyfrankenz we scooped out our nude tips one of them is stuck at the bottom i bet you its one of those damn physicians formula ones  and melted them down in our tiny pan oh oh no smoking no smoking stop smoking  which gave us enough formula to cast about eleven frankennudes we followed the same process with our pink tips ooo that looks like a lava lamp or like a fancy soap yielding enough pink goodness to make about  frankenpinks and then we forged ahead to our reds now that one looks pretty appetizing im not gonna lie  its a little like a chunky marinara sauce and our purples and got about eight red and seven purple frankenlipsticks respectively purple people eater the frankenpurple people eater next up we moved on to melting our brown tips oh wow something crazy just happened a river formed  this further confirms that i am the augustus gloop of lipstick im surprised we didnt make that reference when we were making the lipstick cake from which we made four frankenbrowns and then we finished off the whole thing by melting our two final categories our oranges orange ya glad were making another lipstick  and our unusual colors which i think was probably the biggest mystery of the day what is this going to become  ooh its very galaxy and ended up being kind of a sharky blue grey color but sparkly oh this is up my alley  it does kind of look like alien blood and from those small categories we squeaked by with two lipsticks each so from our mountain of tips we came out with  subfrankenz of seven varieties  its septuplets  all right so i have now tubed all of our lipsticks so were pretty much done on that front which is exciting but what we have not done is swatch them so tomorrow morning im going to have a swatching party with just myself but you know its gonna be a party  tyler will be there yes and you guys will be there in the form of a camera and well all get to see just how they look all right so its a few days later and its time to swatch so i gonna start off with our frankencvs and then directly afterwards im gonna swatch the frankenphora just so we can get our final verdict so first the franken cvs  can i go one more over  yeah there we go thats a better shade  all right ready for the frankenphora  okay so theyre similar  theyre very very similar  if im being crazy i would say that the frankencvs is a tiny bit rosier and like a little bit shimmery and a little bit lighter but from far away they look the same i guess the good part about this is if you wanted the frankenphora last time and you didnt get it you have another shot basically now after staring at a color wheel for a few hours it kind of makes sense that the two lipsticks are similar because even though there are some differences in the individual color stats the lipsticks are still generally made up of the same big four categories and when you break down the colors within those categories they basically shake out to a ton of red and a little bit of blue i mean pink is mostly red and white red is well red nude is sort of i guess like a pinkybrown with white or gray so theres definitely red in there and then purple is red and blue so when you mix all of those together it would make sense to get the tertiary redpurple color it seems like you would either need a lot more yellow lipsticks or a lot more blue lipsticks to really change the mixture to a completely different color and it seems like neither sephora nor cvs really thinks they can sell those regardless of their difference in price point or customer base all right so this is the megafrankencvs on the lips i think it looks quite good it definitely went on quite wet i would say it has uh quite a sheen in terms of coverage i did have to swipe on a few times but i think that the coverage is pretty good after you build it just a little bit now lets zoom in for the inner waterline or butt hole inspection no i think the butt hole looks pretty good overall i think the frankencvs is a pretty attractive lipstick but i do think its sort of hilarious how much time we spent investigating the differences between the drugstore stock and the sephora stock to get literally almost the same color in the end  all right so after that climactic result lets swatch the minifrankenz and see how those look and first up is our nude subcategory all right there she is  it does kind of look like a kkw nude just because its a little shiny  so its got that wet feeling and next up is our frankenpink ooooh thats bright  in the tube it does not look that bright  it looks pretty muted  that is quite barbie barbara millicent roberts  thats barbies full name  yeah and then next up weve got our red color thats pretty nice  its interesting i feel like most of these colors in the tube look more dusty than they do on the arm like it looks almost burgundy in the tube but then on the arm it looks just like a nice almost like strawberryblood if you were a vampire rabbit you would extract this from a strawberry  i am making a bunnicula reference yes and then here weve got our frankenpurple ooooh  that is like a violet almost  i dont really know what violet is but it feels like it could be that and then the augustus gloop brown that is a milk chocolate yes oh that looks so tasty  okay and then next up is our frankenorange  yes  yeah like tang its like a kick on the lips and with that were on to our final color the frankenmisc i guess were going with that  it sounds like frankenfish which is a little more sheer than the other lipsticks all right there we go  if you build it it will come and also very glittery especially on my arm oh look if i do this if i squeegee my arm muscle around is this muscle skin then you can see some of the glitter specks can you see em  bring it aroouund town  after the mild disappointment of the megafrankenz being so similar i am very pleased with how these mini guys turned out they are all very creamy and also generally more vibrant than they look in their tubes and though i enjoy them all i think the red brown and misc are my favourites tyler likes the purple he wanted me to say that so after swatching all of our creations we did our usual full wear test with the megafrankencvs just to see how it would perform throughout the day we did an initial transfer test found a few color dupes at the nyx store and finally did like a taco smudge test i think the frankencvs creamy top layer faded away really fast leaving my lips sort of stained and glittery but this under layer of the lipstick barely moved throughout the day despite some aggressive taco eating so i was pretty pleased with how it performed and so finally here are my lips now eight hours later so i guess i would say weve arrived at the end of our day of wearing the frankencvs and also at the end of our drugstore frankenlipstick adventure now as for what were gonna name this shade it is sort of just like the shimmery version of the berry me in lipsticks color which is the official name of the frankenphora as suggested by you guys last time so i dont know that we need to name this specific color anything different but we do have seven more frankencolors that we created in this video that i would love your guyss help naming please suggest names for those guys in the comments below now aside from that as we alluded to before we are gonna be doing a subscriber giveaway with the  other tubes of the frankencvs that we made but instead of doing like a naming competition this time were just gonna be doing a randomized subscriber giveaway and the rules for the giveaway are that you have to fill out the form that in the description below

this make sure to shmash that subscribe button a big shoutout to surabhi for watching thanks for watching surabhi and i will see you guys anext time the thing is i feel like with other following tutorial videos its a little more relaxed its a little more like oh maybe i have that maybe i dont and with this its like bitch dont die  hello friends and welcome to another video today im gonna be following a soap art tutorial and attempting to make my own fancylooking soap how are we going to do this you ask well buckle up because after doing a little bit of research i kinda sorta know and i will be attempting to explain it very shortly now for some context i am a sucker for fancy soap i love it i can spend probably a good half an hour circling and smelling those fancy handmade soap displays in whole foods or anywhere really i dont even actually prefer using bar soap to like liquid body wash i just like looking at it okay look at it look at it look at it and dont get me started on soap cutting i could watch that ish for days except when it really seems like theyre about to cut their finger that freaks me out so the thought crossed my mind one day as i stuck my head into a pile of soap ostrich style how hard would it be for me to make my own fancylooking soap so i searched online for soap art tutorials and found a lot of very satisfying footage and a handful of videos that will actually teach you how to make soap now there are a fair amount of like fiveminutecrafttype soap pack videos where you can make coollooking individual soaps by basically just melting down previously existing soaps and pouring them into molds but i want to make a whole loaf of pretty swirly soap from scratch so thus began my fancy soaping quest now before i dive into some of the learnings that i have learned i just wanted to give a quick shoutout to wix for sponsoring this video now some of you oldtimers might remember wix as the company through which i designed my very reputable website safiyasnewintrosongcom from the i bought the first five things youtube recommended me video yes that website is still alive and despite seeing that they still wanted to partner with us theyre very nice now if you dont know wix is an allencompassing tool that helps you build design and host your own website with tons of creative freedom and options for like every skill level and you can make a lot of different kinds of websites to suit your needs too so in addition to making musicplaying i guess blogs like i did  will this work  you can also make ecommerce sites for example so in the event that i turn out to be like the beethoven of soap making i could make my own soap store online and share my creations with the world pretty swirly smelly creations dont hold your breath though ill probably end up more like the beethoven the dog of soapmaking but the website will still look good so if youre in need of a website consider wix the link will be in the description below okay so back to the soap so i guess the first question we have to ask when making soap from scratch is what is soap even made of soap in general is made by combining oils which contain fatty acids with sodium hydroxide lye which is a base and honestly by itself pretty poisonous but when you mix those two together you start a process called saponification in which the acids of the oils are broken down by the lye into glycerin and fatty acid salts or these long spermy looking molecules and these little swimmers have a hydrophilic head that is attracted to water and a lipophilic tail that is attracted to oils so when you use your bar of soap the lipophilic tails will grab on to the dirt and oils on your skin and the hydrophilic heads will hang on to the water that rinses it all away  this took me a while to figure out because i havent taken chemistry since  so basically in these soapmaking videos people will combine like an oilmixture with lye water to make a soap batter and then they will add colorants and fragrances and to use a myriad of different tools and methods to get some prettylooking soap unfortunately although there are a lot of these videos that have very aesthetic footage and do outline their process not a lot of them are like fullon stepbystep tutorials for beginners like me but thankfully i stumbled upon this channel called soap queen tv run by this lady annemarie who seems to be kind of like the godmother of online soapart tutorials partially because i think she owns her own company called bramble berry that sells soapmaking materials that a lot of people seem to use and on her channel she details different techniques what equipment you should use and how to handle the whole lye is toxic and can kill you thing and after watching a lot of her videos i came across this tutorial of how to make hangerswirl soap which for the purposes of this video checked a lot of boxes for me its colorful its swirly and if i saw it at the store i would definitely sniff it am i love how each of the hangerswirls just pulled up the colors gorgeous so i picked this one and then ordered everything that she used in this tutorial from her website so we could make it yes yes she got me hook lineand sinker now before we begin i just want to harp on the fact that lye is a pretty dangerous substance like it can burn your skin it can get really hot and erupt out of its container and it can even explode if exposed to the wrong thing so they say to keep kids and pets away from it try not to get it on your skin try not to breathe the fumes in and definitely dont get it in your eyes or eat it annemarie makes you watch like four videos on lye safety before she even tells you how to make soap so just knowit can be bad so on that note lets do this okay so its a couple of weeks later after ordering all of our supplies our many supplies you dont need to pan it looks like a mess and i think that we have everything were going to need now so we are ready to make our soap so basically in this tutorial annemarie makes a soap batter with her oils and lye water and then separates it out into four different containers from there she adds like different colorants to each one pours them into a loaf mold and then uses like a coated wire to move the colors around inside of the loaf to get that hanger or swirl design so there are like plenty of things we have to do t yes s a myriad of steps this is the first time ive ever made soap and in the beginning of the tutorial she specifically states that its an advanced technique and im like okay am if youve never made soap before this is an advanced technique im biting off more than i can chew and i know it so before we really get into it i just want to prep my hanger tool for future swirling purposes so essentially im just going to like uncoil it straighten it out t it looks like a shitty wand stay focused here laughs and then bend it into kind of like a ushape am make sure that your hanger tool is perfectly sized to fit nicely into your mould okay so were going with this as our hanger tool shape t looks good to me so now that thats done we can like get into the recipe and start getting our hands dirty or not dirty because ill be wearing gloves so our first step is to prep the colorants 
now im gonna be using the exact same colors as annemarie in the exact same order im just doing everything exactly as annemarie says i didnt go off the books for anything thats why we have everything from frickin brambleberrycom t it is not sponsored by bramble berry s its sponsored by wix get it straight so basically im gonna take sweet almond oil and put 1 tablespoon into each of these four little cups t shot glasses s you probably shouldnt take shots of them but you could describe them as shot glasses t theyre teavana sample cups s exactly rip alright so were done with the almond oil am then take 1 tsp of each of your colorants then place it in those containers on top of the oil s now annemarie specifically says that she goes lightest to darkest like white yellow light blue and dark blue am so that way i dont have to rinse my mixer in between colors s so im just going with that mentality there will be no rinsing in this video am next take your minimixer and gently move that powder around you dont want to turn on the minimixer and then poof have all that powder just go everywhere s whoo oh my god t oh you better hold that thing s ah i have to hold it t yeah s whoa whoa its vibrating my hand t i think its mixed am give each of these colorants a good blending s why is it making that sound t its plastic on metal saf s sounds like a duck whhoo a little powder sprayed itll be okay this counter has been through a lot all right so ive got my pigments and now its time to measure out our fragrance am im using a triedandtrue fragrance oil from brambleberrycom this crisp cotton fragrance oil it smells well crisp s uh the crisp cotton fragrance oil smells like a really intense childhood memory of a bubble bath am really it smells very refreshing and light s maybe like loreal kids on crack for some reason i cant stop smelling it though i think im trying to get like all of my curious cat sniffing impulses out of the way cause once the lye comes out we cant inhale at all huff now puff later  alright so now i set my fragrance oil to the side and now we do some of the dangerous stuff like combining the lye flakes with the water welcome to the dangerzone so to make our lye water we need  ounces of distilled water and once weve measured that out its time to bring out the lye am now im going to suit up for safety s so im just gonna put my hair up really quick and then also put on my goggles and my gloves just to protect myself from most angles t youre also gonna put that fiends by saf sleeve down too right s ayyy ayyy one of the only things in this video not bought on brambleberrycom ok so now that im suited up for safety im also gonna mention that i am in a wellventilated area with no kids and no pets krusty is not here he will have no part in the soapmaking process in fact he doesnt like soap hes against it in every way shape and form so lets open our sodium hydroxide lye which has been sent to us in this sort of like dangerous orange bag it looks like its a house being fumigated its like dont open me unless you want to make a nice fun craft and which case do open me alright goodbye hazmat suit and then i need four point six ounces okay t do it s trying not to breathe in so after measuring out the lye im gonna stir it into our distilled water with a stainless steel spoon not an aluminium spoon that will explode and the chemical reaction between the lye and the water is gonna make it pretty hot in hurrr alright so its right now at about a hundred and eighty eight degrees fahrenheit and we want it to be about  degrees im gonna put it to the side right now and then were gonna prepare our oil so for our oil we got this quick mix bag that annemarie recommended  am it contains a mixture of slowmoving oils to ensure that i have plenty of time to work on my design s and it came in a bag of  ounces and we need  ounces so were using it all t this is moms spaghetti in general for soapmaking you want to have your lye water and your oils be about the same temperature for this recipe in particular annemarie recommends that they should both be around  degrees fahrenheit when you mix em so basically im just gonna put our oils in the microwave while our lye is cooling down so the two can become  degrees at the same time t boom s so this step is kind of just about waiting i feel like theres been so much going on that i havent really gotten to geek out about the laser thermometer that i got on amazon i was very confused when i first saw annemarie using this because i thought there was like a needle poking out the top that she was sticking into the liquids but no t its a frickin laser s its a frickin laser alright our lye water is at about  degrees and our oils are at about  degrees so now its time to combine them am carefully mix the lye water into the oils by gently pouring down the shaft of your stickblender and pulsing the stickblender off and on s alright so this is my stickblender and basically im gonna put it into my quick mix oils at an angle i think this is called burping it to make sure that theres no air bubbles underneath there am make sure that you burped your stick blender s and so now im going to pour in my lye water whilst pulsing my stick blender alright so thats all my lye water now i get to just mix it am continue stickblending until you reach just a that very very thinnest of trace s so one term that you hear all the time with soapmaking is this thing called trace which basically means that your oils and water have emulsified or in other words you cant see any like streaks in your mixture and its not gonna separate back out into water and oil and people say things like light trace medium trace and thick trace to indicate like how long you should blend and how thick your batter should be is that trace t eh im not sure yet do it for like  more seconds or  seconds s alright so light trace should be pretty liquidy and pourable but it still has to be fully mixed s you know its trace t thats definitely trace its cake batter s alright so now im going to remove my stickblender and then put this my goggles are foggy hello am now split this batch into four different containers s alright as im pouring it out my mixture is looking a little thick but im just gonna go with it and put it in my containers anyway so now all that we have to do is add our pigments to each little little guy am mix in the colorants completely im gonna do the teensiest cystic blends here s ready t lets do this s uh oh t eh t teensie s oh no tyler this looks bad t yeah s this does not look like hers t okay so what happens saf s okay sowe messed up a little bit things didnt really go as planned here i think i overmixed the soapbatter a lot so what i thought was like a thin trace turns out to have been pretty much a thick trace as in like its not liquid anymore and from everything ive read once youve like mixed and thickened up the soap you cant really go backwards and thin it out again so because i went past the thinnest of trace its not really portable anymore so we cant make any art this is a fail were gonna have to do this again unfortunately that means were gonna have to reorder everything wait for it to arrive and then regroup okay so we are back with more ingredients ready to go at the soap again were trying it a second time to see if we can get past the like combining step so im basically just gonna like speed through all of the steps and then we will resume kind of like figuring it out where we left off right when were sort of like mixing the lye water and the oils together like right now i have my oil sort of heated up and i have my lye water like ready to be combined with the oil theres no question that last time we overblended it but after watching a few other videos about you know trace and general like swirling thingies in order to get a light trace i think that we should mix it for like less than  seconds versus like the few minutes we gave it last time so were just gonna blend it a little bit so what im gonna do is im gonna pour down the stick and then once its in i will pulse t oh yeah s it needs to be fully mixed its like with no streaks of oil or anything but thats it then its done yeah alright ill lets go with that t thats like the trace s it doesnt look like annemaries but last time it didnt look like annemaries either i guess that doesnt mean anything alright bring in the dancing lobsters so now im gonna once again attempt to pour the mixture into my containers t oh yeah thats pouring though saf s its better than last time for sure alright now color time for color i feel like i have to go fast this time because besides the overmixing last time i think the longer i waited to pour the harder it got see i guess this is why annemarie doesnt rinse anything cause she doesnt have time what does annemarie say to the god of death aint nobody got time for that t yeah s because the soap is ahardening now we do one stickblend in each container lightest to darkest no matter what happens this time this consistency is definitely less stiff than last time like its pretty liquid still which i think is a good sign alright and now were gonna hand mix the fragrance oil in just a little bit for each im mixing the fragrances in with a whisk for the first three colors so the trace doesnt like become thicker but for the dark blue container im gonna hit it with the stickblender again am thats because this is my very first layer in my soap and i want it to be nice and thick s i think because we dont want any of the other colors to like pierce through the blue now im gonna take my loaf mould out and pour the entirety of the dark blue soap into the loaf mould t that looks pretty good s im just glad its pouring am and then give this mould a little tap on the counter to eliminate air bubbles s alright now lets jiggle this bitch how much you think im supposed to jiggle is this enough t i think youre good s so now that the dark blues in annemaries next step is to spoon in the white soap t half of it s half of it there you go someone remembers t thats why im here am and just slow and easy does it you dont want to get any break through t its kind of making me think the last time we messed it up a  out of  because it feels like we havent done this perfectly and its like kind of looking okay s okay listen this is my first loaf t yeah youre like kim kardashian saf youre doing great sweetie s so if im kim that makes you kris t oh im kris jenner ill take that all day yeah s i wanted to be kris t who doesnt want to be kris am now add most of the light blue onto the top of that white s my light blue is kind of stuck a little bit like right on top t but down below s but down below its pretty soft still so lets pour this while its still good t oh yeah its coming out saf s this isno longer liquid nevertheless im gonna flatten that down with my little spatula give it a little jiggle and move on to the white am use all the rest of that white soap s yeah my white is looking pretty chunky but i refuse to take an l on this ive come too far to turn back now am finally add all the yellow soap to the top of the white you may notice that your soap is getting a little thick if thats the case just give it a quick mix to get it back to loose and flowing s im not sure were gonna get this back to loose and flowy but we can probably get it out here we go here we go t oh its coming its coming t u yeah s okay im gonna get a spoon i cant see a thing theres so much yellow t there is a lot of yellow in here s what is this a coldplay song ssorry alright i think thats all of the yellow wow my goggles are like i literally cant see out of my left eye t youve been sweating s sweating out of my eyeballs whoa its a whole new world out here am and now its time to use our hanger tool s basically what i do is i use my hanger tool that we a very long time ago measured out to this loaf then im going to insert it and then kind of like do like this kind of motion where i like go up and down and back and forth to um swirl itbasically one thing i will say is that its kind of hard to see what annemarie is doing here because its all happening inside of the loaf am a little bit on the bottom up but dont break through the top down and over and up and over s which makes me kind of nervous but at this point theres soap in there and were just gonna go with it so whatever happens now is just gonna happen t youre doing something s its feeling thick to me guys it does not feel like its sort of like t hey its all good s i dont know t did something happen what was going on in there s it feels thick in there t yeah s i dont know if what we got was a desirable result t but youre probably dragging things around s yeah something happened i guess well see am finally remember that blue that we reserved just take a little bit and drizzle it down the middle s my light blue is pretty thick at this point but im just gonna try and like glob some on and then im gonna take a little skewer and try and make a swirly design on top of my loaf like annemarie does the yellow is so chunky on top you guys t actually it looks like the more intricate design its kind of like hey look at this is that a rose is this like baroque you know is that a rococo piano alright so with that design on top this is what im gonna be calling my soap loaf i have no idea how its gonna come out the hanger tool felt like it was sort of going through custard which im not sure is ideal but from here i cant tell how it looks inside so my final step right now is to spray the top of our loaf with some rubbing alcohol am and put this soap to bed s and then im going to leave our soap to like dry out on a heating pad and underneath a box to ensure gel phase which basically means were gonna try and keep it hot as it sets so the colors will end up being more vibrant and then in a couple of days we will cut our soap mould and see what it looks like alright so we are here  hours after putting our soap into the loaf mould and it is now time to take it out and cut it t ooh s and there is the soap so to take the soap out of the mould im pretty sure i just have to like tug on these sides and then flip it over here we go oh were out t its going yeah s tada well it is sort of all over my hands but its out alright that was pretty good it looks artistic sort of the stripes on the sides leave a little something to be desired im not sure that the layers were very even i was spooning them in mostly so that might be the culprit but i will say that the colors are looking pretty good the sides are very smooth to the touch and i am smelling like an overwhelming odor of crisp cotton fragrance i did spill it all over the kitchen basically also so that might be why all observations of the outside of the loaf aside though i think like the true test of my soapmaking abilities t prowess s is how this thing looks on the inside so im gonna get a knife and well just chop this thing open t ooooh is it nice and firm s ooh no actually its kind of soft and nice kind of like a block of cheese its kind of stuck at the bottom oh oh oh its lifting up the loaf here we go oooooh alright anything oh okay i think im starting to see something that could be a swirl there is a hole right there but its almost like a um a wave pattern alright im going back in for more oh oh oh see i keep lifting up the loaf with every slice ooh theres some pattern in there thats something it looks better than i expected based on how it was feeling when i was swirling it didnt feel right but it looks like halfright t i think we should just like leave it at whole foods and see if people pick it up s there is a giant hair of mine right there t oh so were not gonna leave it at whole foods s yeah thankfully the hair is not like imbued into the soap it just was laying on top of it but it was there as i continue to chop i think that some of the bars have like a pretty decent looking design some of them do have like that ocean wave pattern whereas other ones get a little closer to like the actual hangerswirl were going for t yeah where it goes up and down s yeah exactly where it goes up and down i think for some reason i was much better at going up and i dont know why so now that all of our bars have been cut basically what we do is we just have to leave it somewhere kind of like cool and dry for a few weeks to cure just so all of the water evaporates out and leaves you with firm bars of soap but for our purposes the soap art is done so this is pretty much what theyre gonna look like okay so that was me attempting to follow a soap art tutorial in the end we made  bars of soap that look okay i think im missing a little bit of a uniformity to my swirl and i also have a few texture issues with my soap like holes maybe because our soap batter was getting pretty chunky by the time we put the last few layers into the loaf so they dont look quite as nice as annemaries t shes the soap queen though she is the soap queen and i guess at this point i am the soap peasant besides all that i do like the top of my soap maybe even more than annemaries our top is more like textured sort of like you know foam on top of a sea sea foam is what i meant to say and that kind of matches our like wavemotif so maybe there was a silver lining to the chonk in terms of what went wrong to cause the chonk though i think i underestimated how fast i had to move in like the pouring section to keep all of my soap liquid even though we did do a better job with the level of trace to begin with i think that i spent a little too much time narrating the steps and while i was chatting the soap was congealing the only other thing i found really difficult to figure out was the hanger swirl technique i think because i cant really see what annemarie is doing and i also cant really see what im doing its sort of a crapshoot especially because i dont have a lot of experience working with the loaf mold obstacles aside i did enjoy making this soap a lot and i would definitely be interested in making more soap now that i have some of the basics down in fact because we had some extra ingredients i did try this technique a couple more times and i think ive improved on the pouring a lot but not so much on the swirling one time i messed it up like really bad and the next time i did better but ended up kind of low for some reason so the swirls are on the bottom for most of the bar and after rewatching this a few times am down and over and up and over over and then up  s and still not getting it im quite confused sorry annemarie im just a lowly soap peasant thank you guys so much for watching and once again a huge thank you to wix for sponsoring this video i hope there is someone out there who is actually good at soapmaking who could use wix to make their own store i would like to buy your soap please its

a disney character inspired outfit and disneybounding now if you dont know what disneybounding is its essentially using normalmodern clothes to dress up like a disney character without looking like youre wearing a costume so using the same color palette that the character wears zeroing in on specific accessories or just generally capturing the essence of the character in an outfit the term disneybounding comes from the blogger leslie kay who created a general disney fanblog called disneybound back in  basically because she was going to disney world and was excited that she was disneybound then one day she created a few polyvore sets of contemporary outfits based on some of her favorite disney characters and the response was so positive that she made this the entire focus of her blog as a result creating a modern outfit in the style of a disney character became known as disneybounding the trend also caught on because people over the age of  are not allowed to wear costumes to the disney parks i think because disney doesnt want kids mistaking nonpark employees for the character actors that they hire to roam the parks probably both because you dont want kids just running up to random people and also because disney is very particular about the way they train their character actors to stay on brand so disneybounding allows adults to dress up as disney characters without getting kicked out of the park and over the last eight years disneybounders have grown into a robust community of fans who embrace the style challenge of dressing up like different disney characters and even disney rides in creative ways now i remember seeing some of these polyvore edits on tumblr years ago and they always really interested me even before i lived in southern california and went to disneyland pretty regularly but the trend popped back into my head a couple of weeks ago when i saw  had done a video called why adults arent allowed to wear costumes to disneyland so i thought it would be fun to try and to give disneybounding a go myself and then take our attempt to disneyland alright so lets see what we can do so the first step to disneybounding is to choose the character that one wants to bound as now because the disneybounding community is pretty big and has been around for like ten years people have bounded as literally anyone and anything so nothing is offlimits as long as its disney i personally enjoy the classic  animation movies the best preferably ones that came out before  just so it has some nostalgia element for me so that whittles down our list right off the bat im also hoping for a character that has a clear romantic interestfriendsidekick so i can make tyler dress up with me and that narrows it down even further i think the first idea i had was to do snow white i think weve established a bit of a meme around snow white or at least her well and shes definitely my favorite classic princess unfortunately snow whites clear second character would be prince charming who is probably of all of the disney princes the one with the least personality i mean he doesnt even have a name and he makes the questionable decision to kiss a dead body as matpat says number one corpse germs and number two corpse germs snow whites other pair options would probably be one of the dwarves or maybe the huntsman which im not super jazzed about because of that whole he might murder you thing i mean he lets her go but he thinks about it so theres not a great tyler option with snow white in my opinion my second thought was to do a villain character since most villain outfits are more in my preferred color palette my first instinct there was maleficent of all of the disney characters shes probably the one i would want to dress like the most i mean shes got the cape the eyeliner the bold lip the collar and she transforms into a dragon shes definitely petty but she enacts her pettiness in style however there really isnt a companion character to maleficent her only friend is the little crow who hangs out with her and unlike other disney birds he isnt really a character himself other options for a second character could be the spindle and i think thats about it so my third idea for a disneybound was to do jafar from aladdin aka a disney villain with a clear companion now from just some cursory research the jafar disneybound seems like a decently unsaturated space hes been done but not a ton which is ideal jafar is also pretty underratedly stylish hes got a good color palette some pointy shoulder pad action a long sweeping cape a golden cane and some seriously villainous facial hair snidely whiplash who his sidekick the parrot iago is also very brightly colored and has a lot of character so he would be a great disneybound for tyler as long as hes down for it its also kind of topical because the liveaction remake of aladdin is coming out like this month and apparently jafar is hot now just saying so i think jafar and iago should be our choices okay so we have to put together two outfits that arent costumes and also dont include any accessories that would get us kicked out of the park they say anything that drags in the ground is a nono or masks now ive noticed in other disneybounds some people will stick with like a contemporary casualwear look and some people will go for a more midcentury vibe i think because disneyland opened in  theres sort of a  nostalgia wrapped up with the park and disney itself has also started selling disneyboundish dresses in a kind of midcentury silhouette its like a decadebound disneybound now as a decade enthusiast i think the idea of doing a retro disney bound seems really fun but i feel like jafars aesthetic does not really lend itself to this look i mean the shoulder pads say no so im thinking why not pick a different decade to focus on and since and the movie came out in  the early  seemed like an obvious choice the shoulder pads say yes so taking a look online it seems like a direction we could go in for jafar is like a fancy blazer look this is something that in my head is kind of late  like the working girl power blazer but it looks like there were still a lot of blazers around in the early  like at these high fashion runway shows so something like this could be a good base for like a non costume jafar walk now for tylers outfit iago is a parrot or to be more specific a scarlet macaw whose tropical color palette fits well with the  theme as like bright and neon colors were pretty present early in the decade iagos look is more rounded and feathered when you compare it to jafars like very severe angular look so we can maybe ditch the blazer for this one and go for something a little more casual something that incorporates kind of like a colorblock or pattern in iagos general color palette sort of as seen on zack morris from saved by the bell and also very notably on the fresh prince of bel air himself will smith will also wears a lot of these flat brim hats in fresh prints which could function well as a sort of beak now heres an interesting thing hillary from fresh prince of belair kind of wears the blazer style that im going for with my jafar look like all the time so its kind of like were will and hillary from fresh prince of belair now heres an even more interesting thing will smith is now playing the genie in the liveaction aladdin in  so its all coming full circle this feels right well our outfits at least so we went out shopping to a few different stores vintage and non to search for our outfits beginning with our blazer quest not zero yeah theyd be more flip i dont know be able to find a true flip yeah but we need like something we decided pretty early on that we were gonna go for a black blazer partially because there just werent that many red options its not quite right its more cruella but also because jafars outer layers are black and then the inside of his cape slash robe thingy is red this proved to be more difficult than we thought the shape of it isnt quite right now yeah this is more like ringmaster but then we found this mannequin kind of decked out in like exactly the silhouette we were looking for the blazer itself is pretty plain but it has the right boxy look so we decided to go with it as for what to put under it we needed something red so we found this highnecked plain tshirt dress to represent his under cape and with the base of my outfit now accounted for it was time to embark on an accessories quest the attorneys originally im stuck so one of the defining elements of jafars getup is his golden snake staff hes pretty into snakes i mean he turns into a snake so we were definitely on the hunt for some snake stuff we sort of like quickly stumbled upon this golden snake belt that looks right thats pretty cool its not a cobra but it is a snake could be a rattlesnake sure a garter snake which besides being snakey could also serve to cinch our blazer at the waist like with this mannequin so we snagged it in addition to that we also ordered this hand wrap bracelet thingy just for even more snake right now i am to snake as that guy is to cowbell the other prominent accessory that jafar wears is his headpiece which is mostly black but includes a red feather and a red jewel on it now there were a lot of hats in the early  that people seem to have worn with blazers but they dont all look great on me this cant be right no yeah this cant be right its almost like a cyndilauperfromhell look whats happening where am i luckily we happen to have this black bowler hat that we used in our  fashion video that seemed kind of like the right look and we found this red hair scarf that we could tie around it to represent jafars red feather we should just try it out yeah we should just test it out to stand in for the jewel on his hat we found this kind of like a dangly brooch online that seemed like it would pair well with a blazer and also looks a lot like his thing so we ordered that too so with some progress made on my outfit it was time to take on tylers look which started with our hunt for a colorblock top and luckily for us this sort of casual  style is pretty in right now so we were able to find quite a few options to try on thats not bad its just like toucan sam vibes like windbreaker combos its not quite red enough is it no its really green what i would describe as chandler bingesque button downs its kinda like a bowling shirt and this pretty promising hoodie oh thats great that blue looks really good it does have like the wings vibes its very yellow and blue yeah but if the rest of your outfit is red i feel like it would work so we decided to go with this as our top the other main features we had to shop for were his beak and his talons we had mentioned earlier that we would probably want a hat to stand in for his beak i dont know theres so much yellow on this like hoodie i feel like you should go red his beak is orange but his head is red so we figured that the shape of the hat was enough to like suggest his pecking abilities like thats kind of the vibe as for his feet we found a pair of vans that could work could be a talent maybe and with those we were pretty much done with tylers outfit especially since we had ruled out any other accessories early on yoga keanu reeves yeah well you leave vanilli so with our outfits chosen we were bound to disney bound im sticking by that all right so we are here now at disneyland ready to vlog our outfits we did come in the afternoon a little bit just because its a little hot out and theres a roller coaster going by and our outfits are pretty young too steep voice crack really bad frosty oh a parrot we had gotten into the park without a hitch so i think that our disney bounds had passed the not a costume test so weve got a couple of hours of wandering around taking some pictures and then seeing how we look it seems like a popular move to take a photo either with the disney character actor that you are disney bounding as or to go to a portion of the park that has some theming associated with your character for disneyland in la adventureland is the spot that has a little bit of that aladdin agrabah bizarre feel but theres not a lot of it they use them in a lion themed restaurant but its gone now but here all weve got as the bazaar and it was also very crowded your party town is a madhouse this is a busy area everyone wants a piece of it even crying child so for our allimportant to instagram we went somewhere else so were actually right now filming by like where star wars land is gonna be just because theyve gotten good like desert arid looking rocks yeah and with a sufficiently desert ii background chosen it was time to review our final outfits so for my jafar look i ended up with a black bowler hat and red sash our shoulderpadded black blazer a red dress black tights red shiny loafers  golden snakes a golden bag not a lamp but its quilted and a few red and gold vintage jewelry pieces one good thing is that the sideburns are onbrand unfortunately while my sideburns are pretty thick my other facial hair could have been better ive noticed you trying to stroke your beard several times you had a long one recently right that was a mistake i wasnt thinking about the video lack of beard aside i also put together a jafar inspired makeup look that included some purple eyeshadow and some heavy eyeliner to both cement my villainy and also to protect my eyes from the desert sun so the eyeliner serves both a fashion purpose and a practical purpose hes like an evil football player in the desert always exactly so as for tylers final iago look we ended up with a red flat brim hat our red yellow and blue hoodie our red sweatpants and orange sneakers i didnt shave because i feel like iago is the kind of guy that has a 5 oclock shadow or in my case like a five day shadow i dont grow facial hair very fast but i thought it fit the personality now i will say that though tylers outfit had fewer elements than mine i think he embraced his character with a lot of gusto as well as the  vibes feel like im ready like try it there you go there you go yep youre going so fast those are you want to go out of frame all right go for it further further youre not out nope further further are you out though unfortunately i think all of his dancing made him get pretty hot pretty fast after our individual shots we needed a few pictures of jafar and iago together starring marykate and ashley olsen in that pursuit of power and world domination and after a few different attempts including a couple where tyler almost injured himself we finally had a few photos that were suitable for the graham now although disney bounds like dont have to be super obvious to other people i was curious to see what you guys would think of our attempt specifically if you guys could guess who we were trying to be and also if you thought we pulled it off so i uploaded these three photos to instagram to get a few opinions now based on your guyss comments i would actually say that a majority of you were able to identify that we were trying to be jafar and iago i think that tylers posed in the third picture is a little bit of a hint but regardless i feel like its a positive indicator for our efforts that you all were able to guess i was also very excited to see a lot of people guessing our like late  early  inspo like will and hilary from fresh prince lisa and screech from saved by the bell dionne and murray from clueless the heathers just generally and also the backstreet boys in paris gone wrong which is a thing i guess there were also a few less accurate guesses that i enjoyed like caillou carmen sandiego and alvin the chipmunk cruella deville and snow white the pixar ball and my last two brain cells deciding what i should wear so i guess all in all i would say this was a successfully conveyed disney bound mostly now with the social media portion of the disney bounding experience complete it was time for us to explore the park in character watch out mind control uh back off buster do we get some churros you will buy churros and marry me to the princess so we headed back to our little slice of agrabah in adventureland or we did find a magic carpet mosaic to pose next to but disappointingly not much else heres another aladdin themed attraction its a penny flattening machine that is prime content right there theyre really going light on the aladdin tv especially for having a movie coming out yeah also because all three of the designs are milano looms in fact i was pretty shocked at how few aladdin products they had for sale wheres the jafar merch wheres the iago march were both getting us right in the stick here listen im hot now dont you know so i had to settle for some rubber snakes say hello to my little friend do you need more snakes jafar meets britney and then tyler for his part found like a yellow and red macaw that could have been iago or could have just been a rando bird from the tiki room are you in a stareoff with an acrylic parrot like that birdman thats a mating dance are you trying to mate with the acrylic parrot should i be jealous this is bizarre after we had thoroughly exhausted all of the aladdin themed stuff we could find we continued exploring though i would say that the heat of the multiple layers of my outfit and tylers sweatshirt were increasingly taxing all right tylers feeling pretty hot feeling pretty steamy pretty sweaty i knew okay my backs a little sweaty just under the blazer and the belt and the tights but my feet are doing okay for now which is a big win i feel like part of the challenge of disney bounding is that you have to wear your outfit around disneyland and im doing okay so far so after bouncing around the park riding the carousel eating some dinner and trying to steal a giant torch i think it was time to end our disney bounding day all right are you ready to go home yes my feet have finally started to hurt im sweaty fresh prince of belair more like swamp prince of belair am i right about to get a caramel so that was our disney bounding experience overall i very much enjoyed the process of putting together these outfits from choosing the characters to figuring out how to represent different components of their look with modern clothing in our case including a  inspired vibe made it a little more challenging but you know i love me some decades so im always down besides that i also thought it was fun to try and straddle the line between like outfit and costume and i think there is a possibility that we will try disney bounding again in the future come to think of it maleficent and the spindle could be an interesting choice i mean maybe we could get tyler into one of those spiky punk hairstyles that sticks straight up its not necessarily decade appropriate for  but it could be fun thank you guys so much for watching if you liked that video make sure to smash that like button and if you want to see more videos like this make sure to share mash that subscribe button here are my social media handles and a big shout out to carter for watching thanks for watching carter and i will see you guys next time hello friends and welcome to another video today im gonna be shopping for my wedding dress no this one isnt from wish surprisingly so as some of you guys might already know tyler and i are engaged betrothed affianced and since january we have been planning our wedding which has been going pretty well overall we have a great wedding planner who sends me emails probably like once an hour we have our date and our venue and our photo booth it seems like a lowpriority thing to have booked so early but i booked it and im jazzed now one of the things you have to think about when youre planning a wedding is what the heck youre gonna wear its definitely an early foot that needs to drop partially because with a lot of wedding dresses youre supposed to order them like four to six months in advance and also because the dress choice can influence the decor what other people are gonna wear like how youre gonna do your hair your shoes  everything so even though our wedding is later this year were buying the dress now and since ive been an avid watcher of say yes to the dress since its inception in  i thought it would be fun to film the dress selection process and produce our own episode of   well not say yes to the dress  because i dont think we can legally call it that but you know choosing my wedding dress™ we havent actually trademarked that but lets do this anyway so as for exactly what im looking for i have a few thoughts like many people  i have been pinning wedding dresses that i thought were cool to a private pinterest board for years like since way before i even met tyler so between that and a steady consumption of wedding content over the years i feel like ive seen a fair amount of wedding dresses in my time and based on all of that i kind of know what styles im interested in in terms of skirts i dont think i want a super poofy ball gown but i also dont think i want something super tight just because i want to be able to move and groove and also eat so something kind of loose or aline would be ideal in terms of tops im more open to different things im definitely partial to long sleeves but i dont want to be too closeminded to other kinds of sleeves outright for additional context the  foot description of our wedding is like a blend of whimsical and exposed brick so well definitely be keeping that in mind while shopping now in terms of color i know there has been some demand for me to wear a black wedding dress because of my generally dark wardrobe but im not sure i want a black dress i dont need to wear like pure white like im open to a beige or perhaps a light gray or something but based on what ive seen there are just more options for wedding dresses that i like in lighter colors and aside from that i feel like my wedding is the only time i would really ever wear a white dress so i kind of want to go for it i am interested in what ive been calling a black swan moment where i change into a black reception dress but thats not what were gonna be shopping for this time around so with all of that in mind my next step was to find a place that sells dresses for me to try on now after getting engaged i pretty much immediately started looking for wedding venues and wedding dress boutiques in the la area and one store that immediately caught my eye was loho bride short for league of her own which is a relatively new boutique that stocks dresses from a lot of unique designers im not sure they would say this but i find a lot of their dresses to be kind of alternative and definitely up my alley and after stocking their instagram and the instagrams of a few of their future designers i knew that i really wanted to go in and try on some of their dresses and thankfully after reaching out christy bared the owner said that we could come into their la store check out what theyve got and film our selection process there hi im christy im the owner of lo ho bride were a store that specializes in hardtofind designers that arent overly saturated and were excited to have you in today now for our visit to lo ho i wanted to bring an on raaj to give me some additional perspectives and opinions and also because i think thats just part of what you do with weddings oh like bring people to look at you yeah right cheers so i was able to round up three of my five bridesmaids to attend our dress trying on session all of whom are my close friends from college hi im zippy im sophie hi im caitlin and we are the three out of five bridesmaids i feel like if there are three people in the world who have blackmail material on me its probably them but its fine if its fine i just pump them full of champagne its fine so hopefully in addition to exposing me they can also help me figure out what i should be wearing on the big day i think like birkenstocks for sure we should find like bridal birkenstocks its a little veil over the also an additional side note as a fourth member of the entourage tyler will also be in attendance for my wedding dress shopping i know thats not a very traditional choice but i really wanted him to be there not because i felt like i needed his approval on the dress that i chose but more because its kind of difficult to both film a video and also actually shop for your dress at the same time so it would make the experience a lot less hectic if tyler was there to help film on set were also editing this video together so theres really no way around it im not really superstitious though i am a little stitches especially about ghosts but im okay with this one so with tylers presence acknowledged it was time to pick out some dresses to try on now at the boutique they have like one room thats teeming yes teeming seems like the right word teeming with dresses we like for a bride to do a first pass through hami what youre instantly excited about and then well throw in some wild cards so go ahead and start cruising the gallery and well go from there and even though i had done more than my fair share of insta stalking i was a little overwhelmed by seeing all of the dresses in person what do i do like theres a lot of dresses youre asking me yeah now one thing that was important to me was to try on a full range of different styles just because i wanted to make sure that i was making as informed of a decision as possible this ones kind of cool look at that its quite floral which is not usually my vibe but i do like it when like the sort of design kind of like flows to like beyond the bodice oh my god look at this train okay i said it wasnt my style but then it had a giant train which is basically a cape but for your butt i definitely wanted to make sure that i didnt try on too many dresses because people tend to advise against that but i did choose out a few dresses that caught my eye that werent exactly what i expected myself to pick oh this ones kind of cool look at this tie oh its kind of a little fluffy at the bottom the thing is is like im not like married to the idea married married to the idea of having a like super white wedding dress so this nude is kind of cool i kind of like the nude and like the okay lets know about him i did find some of the unique looking dresses i had seen online though oh my god you guys is that a cape its like a slender man but a bridal dress interesting yes this is kind of like our why project like four foot long sleeve denim jacket but a dress is there like an opening in it like where does it open its like a carry arms caitlyns confused like how do you dance or how do you like you dont in addition to our squidward ian dress i also found a shorter but still long sleeved option i wanted to try this looks like the dress im wearing right now but just its a little simple but at the same time like it looks like me kind of you know dinging yeah besides that the bridesmaids also picked out a dress for me to try i like this one i think its definitely worth the try it is quite heavy my arm is getting tired but i would like to try it on once again its kind of like that nude color youre gonna mean yeah send nudes but its just me they made me try on like wonder woman head circling thing to wait zippy was that the one we were picking whats happening but that didnt make it into the dressing room christie also pulled a dress for me to try on so this is a little different from what weve been trying but i thought it could be interesting oh it has all the pearls on there and it can be off the shoulder or it could be a spaghetti strap it could be a fun little wild card for you yeah no lets try it lets start in the mix im open and so with that we had six options to start with hi are you gonna pick out a dress me oh i think thats too many roles broken now i will say that when i was first scouting dresses on lajos instagram i did find a couple that i really loved in fact in our wish wedding dress video i referenced them when i was talking about like dresses that i was interested in but unfortunately they didnt seem to have them in store when we went in to do our tryon but they were still kind of in the back of my mind particularly this one but i really liked all of the six dresses we have picked out and i feel like they had some of the elements of the dresses that i had stopped online so i was very excited to try them on okay im gonna get dressed now okay yeah all right lets do dress number one its a train as a train theres a lot of skirt has a lot of train so our first dress was this floral strapless aline dress from dana her elle i love that and by request of the friends were gonna test a avail available ready its always yeah so this is just a queen veil the dress has a lot going on so i would probably go more clean yeah oh wow now this was actually the first wedding dress ive ever tried on besides my wish wedding dresses and it was definitely the first veil so i was a little like discombobulated how do you feel you feel like a bride i feel like a bride yeah like i definitely feel like a bride i dont know that i feel like me as a bride yeah i only like this dress a lot im very impressed by the cake yeah no its very long also as a side note if my dialogue sounds weird here it was very difficult to get a microphone inside of the wedding dresses so we actually miked the cactus in the corner so please forgive the audio oh and also the veil fell off a bunch of times because my hair is too straight besides those things in regards to the dress itself i feel like through this its like very something im interested in like a lot of trouble but im not sure im like a floral wiiii gal youre gonna need like when i see flowers on me im not sure like a flower i always say theres dresses that you appreciate but if theyre not yours i feel like you appreciate this but its not the one yeah so lets deflower you thats a champagne zinger for sure glass and shes here shes here so with that we moved on to dress number two which was a nude paint splatter ii a line dress by christos costellos hello it has like an ombre blush tone we tried another veil to match this dress im trying like really hard to tilt my head so the veil doesnt fall off so im like hello but it also ended up slowly falling off of my head its a slow descent something about my hair is just weird were gonna have to work on that but anyway i had wanted to try on this dress because i liked the  elements the nude color and i also liked the idea of trying on a dress that had some of the volume of a ballgown without the like roundness or like the pouf from the waist i think that like having the crinoline underneath is definitely fun but once it was on it didnt really feel like my dress im not sure i like like the tank top its both too thick and yet not thick enough i feel like for my shoulders i feel like if were gonna go with a tank style i want it to be like even thicker just to avoid any kind of like chicken wing situation do you feel like my eyes go directly into your boobs i dont know but like the just the floral its just like whoa yeah no there definitely are sort of like floral arrangements like right at the neck yeah its like sprouting forth almost thats very metaphorical im like mother nature not that my boobs being the center of attention is necessarily a bad thing we can do that that could be what the days about but i do kind of feel like most signs were pointing towards this not being my dress so we moved on to dress number three which was our slenderman sheath dress by sophie at voila but we i do think i liked a lot of things about this dress the sleeves are really really really impressive condor and i really liked the sleek sort of broad shouldered silhouette but kind of really were i guess female oscar more oh my god those fairy things from the  that like whirled around often as isis they design dancers yes obviously what are you talking about i particularly liked that comparison because i actually wasnt allowed to have those as a kid my mom said they would take someones eye out which is actually also probably a valid critique of this dress right there yeah no i could slap someone dont love it but imagine just imagine yeah so i think for most wedding dresses you have to bustle up the skirt to kind of like walk around and dance after the ceremony and in this case you can bustle up the sleeves by like pinning them in the back i love it she has her arms she can hug people you can dance that looks so good its cool and the jumper cables are like edgy i actually really liked the sleeves pinned up this way as well it was less slaphappy and more of like a roosting bird you almost look like an owl but there was still some wing flapping potential how does this one compare to the other two for you this one is definitely the best oh i think i really really really like it but im not sure that its the one i felt kind of badass and severe sort of like daenerys from game of thrones but my main concerns were that the sleeves could be like a tripping hazard for myself while walking down the aisle and also that the dress was just generally kind of tight which opens up the opportunity for lumps and bumps maybe after dinner or if a pair of spanx becomes dislodged it is kind of also like awards showy like its definitely beautiful and i think you should wear this at some point in your life but if youre like if youre not sold on it for your wedding were at another time so with that we moved on to our fourth dress which was actually the bridesmaids choice theres a lot of glitter now this dress is like a highlow wrap dress from the australian brand chosen by one day i actually had my eye on a few of their dresses beforehand so it was kind of a happy coincidence that caitlyn picked this one out i feel like a hann of highlighter like i just feel like glitter how heavy is it its actually not as heavy on as i thought it would be to be honest i dont feel the weight yeah its surprisingly light but you know its here now what i like about this dress is that its hard to miss and it definitely brings the party vibes with it i feel the impulse yeah i feel the party calling me like i could see myself breaking it down on a dance floor somewhere maybe literally suspended above it reflecting light you are the ball im the ball you are the ball wheres this gonna dance around you is that you literally being a disco ball yes oh the slow rotation yeah i got it got it totally rotating please but even though i feel like we all had a big positive initial reaction to the sparkle once i stopped moving and kind of took a good look at the silhouette of the dress it just didnt feel like the design was quite right for me and despite it being their choice i dont think that it was the bridesmaids favorite either what do you guys think i liked the last one better what do you think of like the darker undertone i suppose like a white i like the color im not sure its the color thats making me not feel like its a wedding dress specifically i think it was the highlow skirt that made the dress feel a little less like a fullon gown to me and i can kind of see like the short dress yeah yeah im not a fan of the short dress cool all right so thats a resounding no so after the disco gown we were on to our second to last option which was actually christies wildcard choice all right this is the pearl i dont know god its gone this is fun this one is a pearlencrusted off the shoulder a line dress made by dana her l who was also the designer of the first gown we tried on i like this one a lot i definitely do kind of feel like goddess ii vibes in particular i lunched the structured bodice the shoulder straps that strategically covered the chicken wing the loose skirt and also the asymmetric placement of the pearls also i like that it makes sounds i just love that noise hoping that my boobs wont fall out it kind of felt like a modern disney princess gown or maybe like belles underwear with you know like the corset and the petticoat but thats all to say that i thought it was really pretty i think that from what youve been liking it this feels a little girly hmm a little like fruity i think kristi was right that it just wasnt quite my style i think that out of all the ones that weve tried this is probably my favorite without sleeves yeah but i think i just prefer sleeves whether theyre on the ground or just to the wrist i would like some sleeves i think and thats why its good to try on this type of range because yes they hear of killing the curiosity of what other stuff looks like so our final dress brought back the sleeve in a big way its cool right that was a lot of this a lot of sleep haha well not quite as much sleeve as the slenderman dress but theyre definitely there now this dress is like a flowy aline dress by dan jones that has a deep v and not quite bell sleeves more like entire flaps of sleeves looks like a goddess fairy do and it like fits you perfectly yeah the waistline is super super flattering for my part i really liked this dress i like the sleeve i like the neckline i like the waist i like that it like goes out i like the flow enos i do feel comfortable but not in a bad way i sort of feel like elizabeth taylor and like a giant captain yeah its like that doesnt bode well for our wedding right she had like seven marriages i guess tylers right but the point still stands the dress itself was also very lightweight so it was easy to spin and breeze around i was a good control spin i hit someone or something i think it was a bee he is anyway it also had some of the elements of that medieval silhouette that i liked you can get married at the excalibur in las vegas i could you have we are not getting married at the excalibur jurys still out on the bachelorette party though but even though this dress did check off a lot of boxes for me i still wasnt a hundred percent sure its a little more  than like thirteen seventies but i do like it a lot after a little research i think i actually meant eleven  but you get the idea i think one of the biggest things though that was making me hesitate about this dress is that it reminded me a lot of the dress i had really wanted to try on in the first place but its not quite the same so i feel like because im having such good feelings about stress it makes me like know that i want like this kind of style but it also makes me like even more curious about that other dress here what i mean yeah so even though i really liked this dress and also some of the other dresses i wasnt quite ready to commit to anything we had tried on so we wrapped up our session at low ho emptyhanded for now now when we all had like a postmortem after the store i think everyone agreed that the  big sleeve dress was the crowd favorite but when i keep coming back to is there like vneck one with the sleeves but not like the crazy sleeves yeah that one like really just stood out when he lee came out of the dressing room just look so you but i still really felt like that final dress was close but no cigar the only like call and i felt about that dress was that it was like a little knight county yeah too little just a little it really does seem like it would be comfortable enough to wear to bed and although i want comfort i think it might be a little too comfortable for the wedding i feel like i would borrow it from you just like sleep in it was like a big row wearing the wedding dress so i really wanted to show them the other dress i was thinking about which was still flowy but a little more structured so this is the dress that is from a different designer and so i really like now this dress is called the juliet dress made by the brand o to lead the ceremony it reminds me of that black dress that you had in college that was i think black lace yeah bellbottoms sleeves and like flare but it was obviously wasnt long unfortunately it was recently discontinued because they started having trouble sourcing the fabric which is why it wasnt there when we went in i love it it looks really romantic so thats why i cant commit however when i asked christy about it she mentioned that she actually knows the designer who runs ogle in stephanie white and there was a chance that she could make a dress for me using the juliet pattern but just with a different fabric which it seems like shes also done for a few other brides that said because its not really in production anymore there isnt a sample of it to try on so christie proposed that stephanie make a mockup version of the dress also known as a muslin and then we could use that to make our decision so were gonna do this whole thing again unfortunately because making the muslin was gonna take a few weeks we werent gonna be able to have my bridesmaids come with us to lo ho again but i was very grateful for their help in my quest to say yes to a dress dont say yes the dresses i dont thought we have the trademark for that yeah tlcs gonna come after us frocks a frock yeah so fastforward a few weeks and we were ready to return to lo hos boutique all right so we are here back at lo ho bride once again with stephanie who is the designer from oda lean the ceremony and she has the muslin of that juliet dress that i really want to try on im very excited and a whole sweaty i guess its a good thing its a muslin and not the actual dress so without further ado stephanie brought in the mock up oh look at that sleeve tie this looks awesome now once again this isnt the actual dress like its not the final fabric and there isnt any beading or finishings on it its just the silhouette so please ignore any pins if you see them youre singing right sorry but regardless it immediately felt pretty right i love it i really love it i really really really like it i knew i was gonna love the sleeves but i was surprised by how much i liked the other details like the neckline i dont mind the dp oscar my chest waxed and i feel like i pretty quickly realized that this was the dress i was looking for i dont know if were gonna find a better dress i think this is what was in my head you need this was in my head oh yeah this is perfect yeah this is perfect if this has been more traditional and i like just saw you for the first time on our wedding day i think id be a little mushy are you not now youre fired okay so it was time for us to say sure to the frock i really love it no its amazing what are you doing now do i just run away with it so stephanie jumped in to do some additional pinning and measuring to use when making the next iteration stephanies finding all the things that like need to be fixed and im just like the slave now finishing off the dress is still gonna take a few months we still have to choose the fabric were gonna use and we might also have to do another round or two of alterations with the muslin but well get there the next time you see it its gonna look even better so this is my wedding dress mostly im very pleased with pretty much everything about this dress and im really thankful that christi and stephanie are gonna be able to make this dress happen for me is it how youre gonna walk down the aisle you best believe it youre gonna do the carlson down the aisle was going into that real i think itll go really well with our venue and general wedding style which im calling minimalistic set design of an indoor midsummer nights dream in autumn that is actually exactly what i said to our wedding planner she may think im crazy do you feel like prepare to do like a shakespeare speech and this stuff dont get me started do you want to accept that absolutely not because even if no one really wants to hear me soliloquy i think that this dress does kind of have a poetic and romantic vibe to it another thing i really love about this dress is that it feels very much like something i would wear normally for just fancier and obviously longer so i feel very comfortable and at home while wearing it oh my god i feel like they shouldnt be allowed to study this kind of dress and of course i love the sleeves ive probably said that about  times if youre playing a drinking game to this video and sleeves is on your list you did but besides all that im glad that we got this ball rolling because it is a big piece of the wedding puzzle that we now have locked in and i guess also as an unexpected twist i got to make this choosing my wedding dress or say sure to the frock video while also keeping the final final form of the dress a little secret from you guys from tyler and also partially from me at least for the next few months thank you guys so much for

best for showcasingtasting the lipstick i have tried bite lipsticks before as in ive eaten them before and besides the waxy undertone they have a kind of sweet lemony taste and smell so my first idea was that maybe we could make like a lipstick lemon tart or lemon bar and just kind of melt or mash the lipstick into the filling so youd end up with kind of like little pink lemon tarts now i do think that that might work but its not technically a cake and i feel like lipstick cake has a nice ring to it my second idea was to do a lipstick cheesecake and to basically whip the lipstick into the cheesecake batter so we could have like a slightly lipstickcolored cheesecake with a hint of lemony taste i also think that this would work but i feel like the visual impact would be low because youre just going to end up with like a pinkish cheesecake and i feel like thats too normal for what im going for so my third idea was to make a lipstick funfetti cake where we could use small chunks of different coloured lipsticks in place of sprinkles so there would be pieces of lipsticks still intact throughout the cake that you would encounter as you eat this i also feel would showcase the variety of shades the best because they wouldnt just be all blended together in the batter theyd be more like fun surprises so thats what i decided were going to make lipstick funfetti cake okay so with our plans laid i feel like now is the time that i should tell you to not try this at home bite lipsticks are marketed as being made with foodgrade ingredients as in the ingredients are naturally derived and organic from what i can tell theyre mostly just a bunch of different oils and wax so the lipsticks are technically safe to eat as in they shouldnt send you to the hospital but theyre not meant to be eaten as like a snack now according to my youtube analytics the vast majority of you all are over  so you can decide what to do with your lipstick and your bowels but i would say dont eat lipstick definitely dont eat a lot of lipstick no matter how its marketed and dont bake it in a cake please alright so with that im going to go get some bite lipsticks and also some baking ingredients and when i return we shall begin the cakemaking process okay so im here in my kitchen ready now to make my funfetti lipstick cake tyler what are you doing s  so we just got back from sephora where i bought a large amount of the bite amuse bouche lipsticks now i noticed as i was picking them up that some of the containers said only made with like natural and organic ingredients and not food grade tyler they got downgraded s some of them did still say food grade though and t the ones were gonna be eating s those are the ones that are in this bag right now t okay got it s so for our latenight baking session tonight i found a funfetti layer cake recipe from this blog called pretty simple sweet and she seems to make like a pretty goodlooking plain white layer cake and then she sort of folds sprinkles into it to make it a funfetti from scratch cake so my plan is to take these bite lipsticks and then chop them up finely into small pieces not so finely that like you cant taste a little morsel of lipstick but definitely like small enough  that they dont all just like sink to the bottom and then after were done making our lipstick sprinkles we can make like the actual cake so were starting with the slice and dice t this sounds like a bad  article s this girl made a funfetti cake with lipstick and now shes in the hospital  as a sidenote i did buy a few multiples of a couple of shades because they were bright but also just to make sure we had enough lipstick for our cake t so were gonna save this for our wedding too right s right this is our wedding cake t okay cool s yep thats what this is going to be t thats why its so expensive  s alright so these are the colours that we have for our funfetti sprinkles so i think our next step is to just start dicing now i do have a little bit of experience with chopping lipsticks but not with chopping lipsticks to eat so i dunno they seem pretty similar but well see t this is like the great british bake off against yourself s basically against my dignity really alright so im going to start off with cava which is our only like really nudey lipstick you know theres like a couple of different things im thinking before i do the first chop number one being that when we melted all of the lipsticks from sephora together we kind of like tried to get the entire lipstick out including the like sort of bit thats under here so im going to try and like get the whole stick out first and then chop t oh that was sexy as hell s yep see thats what i wanted so now like the whole tube is out let me get a paper towel its already messy and then number two being that im not sure how to do this safely t i dont think anything about this video is safe s yeah no one copy my cutting technique here be safe with knives oh this is sticky t here you go though those arethose are off s they look like tiny like pieces of sausage slight thick pepperoni vibes i kind of wonder if like for example i should cut the sort of thick ones in half t maybe s i mean theyre definitely not going to be uniform sprinkles whatever we do t you dont say s this is a massacre t it is quite gruesome s yeah this is a bloodbath alright im going to move on t i mean if this wont get gordon ramsays attention what will  s truly what will alright they are very sticky to each other this is going to be very interesting im bringing out the chopsticks just to separate the sprinkles i might have to place these sprinkles in one at a time t the only flaw in this plan safiya is youre not that good with chopsticks s im not great at chopsticks t yeah s but im probably better with chopsticks than i am with knives i wonder if i should like maybe freeze them before i chop them because right now im getting a lot of sort of like sticking and not like melting but kind of like softness so i wonder if they were a little crispier if theyd be better to like cut i think also going forward im going to try and use some parchment paper just because the lipstick is sticking to the cutting board a lot so im just going to transfer them by chopstick while the other lipsticks are in the freezer my chopstick skills are really being tested right now and they are coming up medium alright so its been like ten minutes should we see whats up they look the same t yeah s they look exactly the same t well maybe their consistency is different s alright so lets take one of these frozen lipsticks and see how it does this might be firmer t i think it looks firmer s this might be better yeah let me try and chopstick them out ready t oh that kinda lifted s that looks much better i gotta be honest okay so based off of that chopping session i feel like putting them in the freezer does actually help the slice so im actually going to stick these back in the freezer and then take them out one at a time when theyre ready to be chopped t im just wondering if these little snippets are like more or less dense than cake s its hard to say im hoping that its less dense obviously so it kind of like floats along instead of like sinking this does kind of remind me of a specific episode of the great british bake off where mary berry has given the contestants a cherry cake recipe and like part of the challenge is that you have to chop the cherries finely enough that they will stay like suspended throughout the cake and not sink thats kind of what i based the whole vision of this cake on t yeah s like a little alright so we are mostly done chopping our lipsticks weve just got one left this green one called kale  so lets just chop that one right up and then we can put them all in the freezer and then move on to the actual baking i feel like that was definitely harder than i thought it would be but at the same time im not sure why i thought it would be easy t i think that i thought we could dice it almost like an onion s yeah t but its lipstick s also i look like a serial killer just my hands the cutting board the knives the chopsticks t the rags s i mean the rags just everything so i guess ill just do a little cleaning up really quick alright so now its time to follow these instructions so i can actually make the cake part of the lipstick cake so ie started preheating my oven to  degrees and while thats happening im gonna make our batter so my first step is to sift all of my dry ingredients together in a mediumsized bowl look at my myriad of containers im all about that unified aesthetic am i rosanna pansino yet t definitely not s definitely not although i did ask her a question about this recipe i texted her late last night is this working at all can you see anything t its definitely working try to keep it inside the bowl though s i dont remember which one of these are baking soda baking powder and salt but regardless theyre all going in so those are my drys so next up we have to move on to the wets i love the way butter smells t a lot of people through history have s alright now that the butters in lets go for the sugar i feel like this looks like the intro to aladdin and now its time to mix ope its not plugged in everyone its not plugged in 
t yeah s do i just stick it right in im so bad at baking i am so bad at it t no yeah thats what you do  t thats looking like something s yeah it looks like mashed potatoes alright there we go thats some butter and sugar i think okay so now im gonna add my eggs one at a time whoo that was a plop if i ever heard one honestly this looks so appetizing at this point like this is what i want to eat okay and then the last thing before we put in our dry mixture is 1 tablespoon of pure vanilla extract i feel like my fingernails look so dirty to be baking but i keep washing my hands and the lipstick wont go away so now im gonna add my dry mixture to my wet mixture as well as adding  cups of buttermilk it looks so funky t it does look funky its like greek yogurt s ope t onto the shirt s ive been hit mayday she says not to overmix the batter so im trying to not follow my instincts t yeah  s im like okay stop now stop now boom and that i believe is our batter so now that our base batter is done the next step in the recipe is to fold in the sprinkles but of course for us our sprinkles are lipstick shavings now something that ive been nervous about from the beginning is the lipstick chunks being too big and then sinking to the bottom of our cakes so im wondering if for some of these we should chop them in half and then i will just basically drop them in and then fold them into our batter with one of my little is this a spatula t yeah s folders folder guys this is gonna take me awhile to drop all these in it is at this point in the night that i question what are we doing as i place lipstick slivers in this batter half by half via chopstick i wonder how did we get here alright im gonna fold this first layer of sprinkles in i am trying not to squish any but there are a lot by the end im gonna squish one i just feel it coming t no yeah s alright i feel like our first fold went okay just like five more of those and well be all good i think this layer is gonna be the reds the reds ended up being the messiest because they were the softest so their sprinkles are more splotches i think that this is the point when we ask did we cut too much lipstick i was actually just thinking will the cake stain your teeth could you apply lipstick to your face by just rubbing it into the cake t well youre gonna have to try that s yeah  t were gonna have to just pie you with the cake alright and then this is going to be our final layer of the chips i did just get a sort of chilling thought though what if the lipsticks melt so much that they almost create just running streams of lipstick throughout the cake so its not really funfetti its like murder t bloodfetti s yeah alright im done i probably shouldnt have touched my hair so now im going to dole out the mixture evenly into these three cake pans i am seeing lipstick pieces in there t oh theres a lot of lipstick in there safiya its like an mm cookie s oh im so on board with that do i like flatten it out and then it rises is that what happens with cake t i believe thats possible s  thats possible okay so my cake is divided time to put it in the oven and see what the fk happens one two and three so now we wait  minutes to find out if this was worth it im nervous i didnt get to take a walk alright so this is  minutes into baking  it looks like its baking normally i think its very difficult to say i dont wanna leave the oven door open too long okay so its been  minutes and the bottom two dont look ready but this one on top looks like it could be ready ohhh ty it looks fun it looks kinda holey but it smells good and it looks kinda like a muffin im just gonna get a toothpick to test if its ready or not came out clean alright so that is one of our layers of our lipstick funfetti cake i think this is working t we just might pull this off s what on this green earth is happening okay i feel like the last two are ready to come out what do you think oh this one has some wax like right at the edge i hope that doesnt stop it from coming out of the pan alright so im pretty sure this is cake they seem to be at least at first glance structurally sound so i think we just have to let them cool for a little bit and then we can depan them and stick them in the fridge i turned the dishwasher on because i forgot that we still had to film its so late right now i let these cool for an hour its 5 alright so everything that ive seen about removing cakes from pans is that you have to do it like you know when you catch a spider you like put a piece of paper and then i guess you dont have to flip a spider but in this case were putting something on the other side of the cup and then flipping it t it doesnt feel right s no it feels fine im just nervous t alright flip moms spaghetti s  yes both whooooooa t whoa what is that it looks amazing s it looks like a map of the world well not our world a world it is kind of stuck to the parchment paper so im just gonna tweeze it off very carefully hoooooooh yeeeeeees it looks pretty damn cool to be honest alright so im just gonna put some saran wrap on this and then put it in the fridge until were ready to decorate and then ill do the same thing with the other two t i mean this came out very funfettiish in my opinion s its a little more continental than funfettiish t yeah s but still a cake alright into the fridge it goes and into my bed i go goodnight sweet lipstick cakes i will see you in the morn alright so its the next morning and im here and ready to make my frosting and frost my lipstick cake so our frosting will obviously go on top of our cake but also act as a mortar for our three layers and for our frosting we need a lot of butter and a little bit of salt did that make it in t i i think so s did i just throw it over my shoulder compulsively t you did fling it s then were gonna mix those together and then add a lot of powdered sugar look at me im in an episode of narcos and then add heavy cream and vanilla extract this is the part that i asked ro about cuz in the recipe they say heavy cream but i could only find heavy whipping cream and so i was like ro is this the same thing and she was like good and decently long explanation and i was like cool alright so now i have to whip i think t wheeeeew are you feeling it in your arm s i feel it in my fingers and my toes christmas is all around me t well at least powdered sugar is s whew and that is frosting so now that weve made our main frosting were gonna move on to my special frosting now since we came up with the concept of this cake ive been trying to figure out how to incorporate lipstick into the frosting or decoration of it and ive decided the best thing to do is to make more frosting and then mix lipstick straight into the frosting with a hand mixer so we kind of have our main frosting and then our little decorative frosting that we can put in a piping bag and make the accent color i did have a few other ideas like putting melted lipstick straight into a piping bag and then trying to pipe it out on the cake but i tried that and it does not work oh my god ty look at the bag is totally melting the bag is about to burst the bag is melting
t whoa whoa whoa whoa s the bag is melting so this is my most recent and hopefully best idea alright so im just gonna try and blend these in here  t oh thats working s oh yeah t that worked great s whoa this is awesome sorry frosting is flying the bowl is too small  alright so thats our frosting i feel like the lipsticks got blended in almost immediately and we ended up with this awesome bubblegum pink color so with this done now its time to take out our cake and ice it ive got a cake stand im professional alright so im gonna use this one as the base how do i transfer it giant spatulas i do have a giant spatula t oh you could use that s alright here its comin t oh my god yes s oooh thats working where did that giant spatula even come from t remember when we were making giant eggs s we did that t no s oh  for a second i believed you too i was like wait which video was that for okay so now that i have my first layer on my cake plate im just gonna frost the top of it so then we can put the second layer on top of that layer im also not gonna frost the sides of the cake because thats what pretty simple sweet does she kind of leaves the sides bare so you can see the funfetti alright that is layer number one so now i have to remove layer number two from its cutting board listen it was 5 am we thought cutting boards was the way to go i feel like im doing okay for someone whos never done this before t you mean make a lipstick cake right s i mean make like any cake and frost it to any capacity t dude this thing is tall as hell s shes tall shes a tall one mr grinch alright so now we have to do like one top layer of frosting now i know that the frostings not gonna be like perfectly smooth so im trying to make it artfully swiped one might call it rustic t rustic s i dont know im trying okay so here is our cake mostly fully formed so i think the things to do now are the sort of decorativejajing steps so im gonna put a little bit of the white frosting in a pastry bag and try and fill in the cracks on the sides a little bit and then im gonna put our pink lipstick frosting in a different frosting bag and do a little flowery stuff on top im kind of trying to do what pretty simple sweet does by adding some swirls to the rim i dont think we have the same piping head though t you do realize this is not an episode of cake boss right s i feel like it is alright so with the addition of six pink poop emojis to the top of this i declare this cake finished so the moment of truth has arrived its time to cut and serve our lipstick cake im terrified t im a little nervous s so im gonna use this incredibly sharp knife which im not sure is ideal for cake cutting and then ill serve myself a big slice of lipstick pie t cake s cake alright ready this is like one of the moments of truth tadaaaa damnit get it off t you need a hand s no no no leave me alone dont even breathe a slice of lipstick cake badoom so this is what the crosssection of the cake looks like as you can see weve got some sort of like holes where the lipstick is it seems like some of the lipstick chunks were big enough that they melted and then resolidified and drooped a little bit but other pieces seem to have like fully dissolved into the cake and are more just like splotches of pigment now it doesnt seem like theyre all just at the bottom though which is good okay so i should probably stop stalling and eat this thing shouldnt i t ooohhh yeah s yeah look ive got a big chunk of lipstick at the bottom oh yeah thats wax thats bigtime wax alright ready t yeah s cheers to all of you watching at home heres a big ol bite t eh t eeehhh t concerned face t uh oh s thats amazing t oh yeah  s thats so good t thats good s theres definitely a bit of a waxy feel but it almost feels like a thick frosting t whats that stuff called that they make those roses out of like fondant s no its much better than fondant t oh yeah s fondant is hard this is chewy i definitely taste the lemon thats in the bite lipsticks like definitely t oh a little lemon cake action s it almost cuts the super sweetness of the vanilla cake and frosting so it kind of complements it nicely i feel like this doesnt help the whole dont try this at home i still do not recommend trying this at home but you know in the name of science i would say this experiment was successful is there any lipstick on my teeth t amazingly there is not show me your tongue no youre good  t okay i feel like i need to try the frosting on top t yeah s oh my god its all coming off oh its all coming off alright were good cheers skal okay the lipstick frosting is where its at i think with the cake you get more direct shots of lipstick but the lipstick frosting is just like lemon and frosting its damn good alright tyler you wanna come try this t yeah im comin thats so good  that is lemony s yeah t those taste amazing its almost like a gushers cake s youre going in for more t omm s alright i have a question for you
t yeah s how much would i need to convince you for this to be our wedding cake t oh s heres the thing feeding it to other people is a little dicey t legally s yeah i feel like maybe we shouldnt t no i mean it would take no convincing on a nonlegal basis but on a legal basis i could be talked into it s alright so this is our lipstick cake so after trying a couple of bites im not sure how much more i could actually eat in one sitting because it is very sweet but i think thats for the best i feel like we dont really wanna test the limits of how much lipstick can you eat in a day cuz we could probably get to the end of that number pretty fast i am honestly very pleased with how this cake came out i feel like when we started this process i had a lot of questions a lot of fears but after all of the trials and tribulations of making this cake i think we came out with something that is a cake with lipstick inside and on top but i guess even though it tastes good well see if anything weird happens inside of my intestines okay so this is my  hours later checkin now i will say that nothing explosive happened downstairs but i did feel rather waxy inside for the first couple of hours after eating the cake so take that as you will i did though want to try to apply the lipstick in the cake onto my actual lips i forgot to do that when we were tasting the cake yesterday so im just gonna do that really quick and see what happens t that is going on saf s do i look like miranda sings t its not that overlined but you do have very red lipstick on s flip it for me so i can see it oh t yeah s oh shes still pigmented after going through the oven thats pretty impressive so i guess you can bake your lipstick and wear it too thank you guys so much for watching if you liked that video make sure to shmash that like button and if you want to see more videos like this make sure to shmash that subscribe button once again a big thank you to honey for sponsoring this video and you can download honey at the link below here are my social media handles and a big shoutout to lu for watching thanks for watching lu and i will see you guys anext time hello friends and welcome to another video this week im gonna be getting my closet professionally organized thats right were gonna marie kondo  this biatch so as you guys may know a few months ago i had a crew of professional organizers from practically perfect la help me declutter and reorganize my makeup collection which was previously haphazardly stored in giant plastic bins im like that michael scott gif its happening its happening and since then i have been thoroughly enjoying my new vanity and le gasp actually maintaining the organizational system that they helped me build well i did add an entire new cabinet for more lipsticks but thats not against the rules as long as its labeled its fine right regardless i decided it would be fun and also actually very useful to have the professional organizers help me tackle other areas of my house and  lets be real  life that needs a little tlc so this week were gonna be taking my clothes headon its gonna be a lot of black shirts now the total number of clothes that exists in our house is substantial but it is split into two categories personal clothes and clothes we get for videos or like prop clothes and to be fair to myself i have kept my prop clothing pretty wellorganized i have a bunch on display downstairs in this big room that i eventually want to be able to film in and maybe instagram more and all of my other video clothes are filed away in wardrobes in our garage sorted by production all of our shoes are also on racks down here my personal clothing however is not quite as nicely kept and cared for and is sort of just squished into every possible orifice upstairs in our bedroom cabinets armoires drawers closets hanging any way you can imagine weve got clothes there so for this organizational session i think were gonna be focusing on personal clothes because those need the most help i would say were surviving were not thriving were survival swimming through piles of laundry now my wardrobe has sort of slowly grown into the black hole that it is today over the last five years i moved down to la after college with a fair amount of clothing and i have acquired a lot more since then simultaneously i have pretty much got rid of none of it along the way so if my closet were an infographic it would be like a barnacle growing slowly but steadily and its time to start scraping some off now for this video i think we are going to tackle tylers closet as well because its also up here in the bedroom and i feel like if we want to optimize the room and its overall system we have to do his stuff too he has fewer clothes than i do but still a lot of stragglers that he hasnt worn in years which are headlined by his collection of ancient gym shorts
tyler yeah these ones are actually from the fourth grade saf to be fair he does actually wear those now just so you guys can understand what were working with im gonna give you a quick tour of our room starting with my main closet which is this way through our bathroom tyler okay
saf is this like vogue  questions but jake here in here i have a lot of hanging clothes like tops dresses a few skirts and pants and to my small amount of non black clothes it seems like its just a need but in reality you just dont have a lot of colorful clothing no the meme has become my reality yeah i live in a meme now i have attempted some systems in this closet but theres just too many items squished in here for me to actually see my options tyler this is a really like a reaching grab and go type closet saf no this is a lock yourself inside and descend into the madness closet ive heard that the entrance to narnia is back here
tyler oh yeah no i try to find it saf there are also a couple of random straggler items in here like some of my jewelry and an empty basket this big thing here is our like toiletry and bathroom storage area we dont have a lot of like drawer space or cabinets in our actual bathroom so this ended up in here i feel like its pretty normal dont look in there but its pretty normal i swear so back in her actual bedroom we do have these like large mirrored units that were actually left by the previous tenant but instead of trying to move them we just decided to usurp them they look unbelievably heavy so in this one is mostly my clothes actually i think all of these things have my clothes in them ive never opened oh i will say that one thing that hinders my organization is that a lot of our storage pieces were not purposefully acquired to fit our clothes or this room like this dresser tyler bought when he moved down to la like seven years ago and we still just have and once again these things were just here when we got here which is cool because free stuff but at the same time the insides are arranged for someone elses wardrobe so im really just putting my six belts in a giant drawer because i cant use this drawer for anything else this one over here is also filled with my stuff theres like a large amount of blank space on top i basically have nothing hanging up there i just didnt know what should go there so clearly these things are not really optimized for us but im not sure what we should do about it the last of my clothes are in this chest of drawers over here in which ive got mostly bottoms like tights underwear shorts and a lot of yoga pants im actually ok with this unit except for the fact that i have an entire drawer of secondstring yoga pants that i dont like that much so its a pretty obvious candidate for stuff that needs to be decluttered now as for tylers stuff it pretty much exists in this closet and this chest of drawers which has the majority of his non hanging clothes like his boxers and socks including socks that tyler has stolen from me
tyler i dont like rolling my socks saf no you just take all my socks and the thing about his dresser is a lot of his drawers are so full its hard to open them which kind of makes him not use his dresser anymore like i can barely open this drawer now over in tylers closet he has some stuff strewn about up top and then up here weve got a fair amount of things hanging that like tyler does wear like hoodies or like zip ups but there are also a fair amount of shirts that are hanging up here that tyler definitely doesnt wear ever ive never seen you wear some of this stuff so i think basically everything on this side of the door should probably get donated so besides that the only other place that clothes go are the hampers now i am a hamper fiend like i have a lot of hampers around me at all times so i think right now i have two over here for tylers clothes and i have five over there for my clothes tylerwhat is that system 
saf dont even ask besides all that i would say that our room is like pretty sparse right now in terms of decoration so like maybe even though its not exactly part of the whole like professional organization of the closets deal we might go out and see what kind of decor we can get to kind of jazz up the place so now that weve all seen our situation we have to show our professional organizers the situation okay so joni and kit and devan from practically perfect are back at it again for the closet and the first step of our organization journey was to have them come in and try to formulate a game plan
joni well why dont you show us all  where all the clothes are kit well you youve surprised me because i thought this is where your clothes were but youre telling me theres another
saf there is another closet
kit okay kit maybe lets start there saf now joni and kit and their team at practically perfect organized all different types of spaces but with the many many closets theyve done besides the decluttering they seemed to really zero in on uniform folding and storage solutions like drawer dividers baskets and labels if theres anything i learned from last time its that they love a good label and their goal seems to be to get your drawers and closets streamlined and looking good thats that good drawer porn right there oh yeah so while they were looking around in addition to some of the obvious problems like the clutter joni and kit were also concerned with the flow of the room kit logistically youre getting dressed in the morning you jump out of the shower youre coming out here saf yeah
kit getting your bra underwear walking back into the closet
saf yes
kit so its a lot of back and forth saf yeah im just wandering on naked a lot and also tylers dresser
kit is this an everyday access for you tyler kit okay
tyler they get stuck
saf so with everything surveyed they gave us our diagnosis kit well i think the game plan is to start helping you edit and then working with the pieces that you have and then seeing how we need to fill in the gaps to make it super functional and organized and easy for you guys to maintain
saf with the plan being that we would allocate two days for this project with day one being devoted to scaling back our total items and day two being all about that drawer porn alright so we have the team assembled and we are here for closet organization day one so what do we do first joni were gonna start in the main closet in your closet saf the main closet  just kidding just kidding  roasted  and basically the idea was to grab individual sections of clothes hang them on this rack they had brought with them so we could see them and then edit them back joni well its clear to us that theres more tops than anything else so theres thats gonna take a long time and i would say that might get tiring saf yes
joni i would say lets tackle it 
saf with crop tops being the first subcategory to address joni so ideally youre gonna say keep or donate but there might be some questionable ones that we can put off to the side saf we also had a relocate category as in the clothes belong somewhere else like amongst our video props or in a different section like workout stuff so with that in mind we dove right in
when is a cute top i like like this conveyor belt im like oh let me receive it this is a top that i actually havent worn in a while because of the way its cut i always get nervous about like whats this my little chicken whiz yeah like society i think something i had to come to terms with early on was that even if i liked something about a piece of clothing if i didnt feel good wearing it i probably wouldnt ever wear it this sounds like maybe we should donate that alright yeah other things that ended up being donated were tops that had just fallen out of the rotation i havent worn this in a while i feel like this meme is kind of dead i know this i also feel like is they get rid of i have not worn this since  there are so many hands happening and grabbing things from me im like yes take it away as well as things that never really entered the rotation like purchases that just didnt look how i had hoped on me why dont you like that in by the way i dont know its something about the sleeveless ness i feel like it makes me look like a paul brother this shirt is a shirt that i dont wear but i bought it to go with other things in my closet that i also dont wear besides the style fails there were also a select few items that i didnt really recognize when was the last time you wore it i have no idea anything i think weve all already seen it but of course there were quite a few things that i wanted to keep i like this shirt this is this is a very its just a its a black tank top leave me alone leave me alone yes i did keep a lot of plain black tees dont at me i also kept a few shirts that i havent worn in a while but are kind of sentimental the alien shirts might actually be good luck were gonna keep those as well as rediscovered some hidden gems huzzah its my benjamin franklin shirt shirt well okay so this was like a shirt that i bought i like the benjamin franklin museum in philadelphia and i like cropped it to be like huh sides a crop top admittedly i dont wear these that much even though i do enjoy them i dont know so i transferred them to the workout pile because im hoping ill wear them to the gym and after going through a few more items we reached the end of the crop tops alright i was counting and you let go of  crop tops and i cropped them from the wardrobe see what you did there i need more coffee so next up from my closet were the fulllength tops this is quite a robust section of which i still wear quite a few this is a good top this is definitely a workout top but i wear this a lot you shouldnt give that away now no very soon depending on how gameofthrones ends i may donate that later so while i did have some to give away i kept a fair few of them some of which were more functional and others which were more flashy born wild tyler where did this shirt come from why would i buy i almost feel like we cant get rid of it because its like kind of magnificent you know it could probably go with like oh pajamas isnt a bad idea yeah oh could be a pajama top yeah okay pajamas besides the mysterious appearances of new tops some very old school tops also surfaced oh this is a vintage shirt from  its made it pretty far i feel like it should go downstairs with our like  clothes no comments one bad impulse i do have is that when i find something thats old enough i kind of want to keep it just in case we want to do a video with it in the hypothetical future and like maybe one day i will want to dress like its  who knows im gonna need this that is a dangerous one yeah but joanie and kit let a couple slide so after zipping through the rest of the tops we had only a few categories of my hanging clothes left including my colorful clothes the funny thing is like of this pile like most of them are white and gray most of this stuff was left over from my college days so i havent really like looked at any of these things in a while so i feel like this is about to be a bloodbath this we can give away this we can give away this we can give away this is kind of a good shirt i didnt leak eep a couple of items that were just too fun to get rid of oh look this is my hocus pocus like football tshirt but most of them had to go i feel like if i wore more color i would wear mustard but i dont hopefully itll make someone who receives it happy i will not reveal what happened to this one though your sister gave this to me for christmas can i get rid of it or will she be mad i think she watches about  of our videos i think you put the coin all right just dont mention it after this so next up were jackets and bathing suits this is my only blazer which would keep this most of the jackets ended up in the keep section i just wear a lot of these jackets actually a pheromone although i was able to declutter a swimsuit or two this is a swimsuit i bought in miami because i forgot a swimsuit but then it turns out in miami they dont worry swimsuits that have butts on them after some quick hanging bottom editing we got to the last hanging category the dresses yeah the rack is like really having a hard time not yet not yet but today could be the time a fair amount of these dresses were like college party dresses that i ended up giving away thats a good buy i dont know there was like a time where we went out and then we dont anymore though there were some schmancy dresses that i kept just in case i just want to be invited somewhere that i could wear these so these are like a im waiting for the time i can wear these heather take this girl somewhere fancy for gods sake regardless we made a pretty big dent in the dresses category okay so i think that thats all the stuff on hangers that was a lot so which we do next we should go through and edit all of the items that are folded in your dressers and also in this wardrobe back here so we dumped all of my pants and bottoms that were folded onto the bag and as i was editing my collection i noticed that joanie and kit had a particular style of folding her what are you guys doing what is this what is this this is this were doing a little folding specifically they were doing the recently popularized file folding method where every item is facing up when you open a drawer kind of like the spines of books on a shelf and basically what you would do for these pants for example is to fold them down the crotch then fold the legs into thirds and then do one last fold so the pocket is visible as the spine of your pants book i feel that so youre saying like if it werent this way then we get who looks the thing youre going through your drawer and youre like oh this jean pocket this is the one i want were turning to the editing i got rid of most of my shorts though i did keep this winky but one and i also decluttered a small mountain of yoga pants leaving me with some serious real estate are those all of my yoga pants yeah that looks like room for more i feel like were enabling you in a way that i dont like we finished up my round of editing by going through the underwear and the bras i feel like bras are so unwarned by me except for like two bras thats what most people say and with that my side of the room was done thats the edit look at the pile tie so with my stuff down it was tylers time to shine okay so now were gonna go through my closet and my drawer and do the same editing process that we did with the feels look at me narrating okay now our method for approaching tyler stuff was just to take everything out of his closet and dresser and dump it on the bed just because it wasnt really previously sorted into categories well this system is not practically perfect approved tyler effortlessly yeah i think you can just like look at rows so we figured it might be best to just start from scratch now in addition to his wardrobe just slowly growing naturally over the years tyler is also self admittedly pretty superstitious about getting rid of his clothing which is probably why his drawers are so hard to open a lot of good memories in here i can tell youre gonna be a sentimental client once everything was laid out on the bed it was time to start making some choices i love this one sofia got this for my birthday a couple years ago its pretty great its impossible to wash but i like it now some of the stuff tyler wanted to keep he does wear and like i wear this one all the time but he did have an impulse to keep it all we got this for christmas in  didnt we yeah we can keep this one i think its its not will you wear it lets say we open a microbrew in colorado or something okay were gonna need this right alright well get rid of this one yeah no matter how long its been since he wore it i used to wear this all the time i dont know i almost last time you wore it 5  really it stopped fitting at the end of college tonys given the i need your help i need your help joni come on i hear its hard but with the help of joni and kit joanies giving me the hard shake this one i just i dont see you in that he was able to get through a lot of them you think its bad mojo vy throw it away i feel like that thing helped me get like an a in a math test h grade im like oh yeah i got problems im really weird about clothing but even though tyler was able to make a big dent in his scarcely worn short collection we did keep his only vest oh this is from my tyler timberlake era yeah its like that when vests are really in or like in  when everyone liked muirs now the real crowning glory of tylers closet are his antique gym shorts these were like i found these in the locker room my high school do you just pull the drawstring cuz the elastic is gone i folded a couple times yeah and honestly im proud of him for giving any of them away because hes been dragging most of them around for decades dont worry though we did keep a couple these are my  little league basketball shorts i love these ones i wear these all the time rounder valley that was the basketball league where they didnt keep score as we wrapped up editing down tylers closets our cat crusty appeared to insert himself in the situation he like thinks this is exciting right now it is exciting i think christies an organizational enthusiast he might be so with that and a little underwear editing we were done with tylers clothes dad you did it there we go now a while ago i had mentioned that tyler has this habit of stealing my socks so all our socks are now mixed together thusly we had waited to organize them last what should we do well tell me why they would be together tyler takes my socks yeah part of this is because tyler and i have similar sized feet and i also dont like rolling my socks but i like rolled socks in there ill just take them okay well im gonna mediate the situation does it bother you to share a sock drawer it does not bother me actually what bothers me is going to my sock drawer and then not having socks so the solution was just to have an intentionally shared sock drawer im okay with that okay thats very cute you guys i have to be honest you might be our first shared sacrifice and with an alarming amount of sock editing sorting and folding all of our closet decluttering was done all right you have gone through everything that you know thats awesome some major all on the j by the way and youre still here i was gonna say youre standing but im not standing nope im sitting so after a long day one of editing down our closets i was pretty proud of our giant piles and i felt like we had really cut into the clutter but we were now faced with what to do with what we had left okay so its day two i am wearing the exact same thing because my clothes are everywhere but soon they will be organized so today were actually rethinking where all of your items should be stored so weve decided what youre keeping and now we need to make a plan based on that and were thinking of actually reconfiguring these great closet systems that you have so that they work a little bit better with the items that you own so when joanie and kit had come by initially to survey our closet they noticed that these giant mirrored cabinets are ikea wardrobes where is this piece time yeah and they have these slots on the side so you can customize the drawers and shelves inside of them either by moving them around or by buying specialized ones for your organizational pleasures and joanie and kit chose out a bunch of these inserts that they thought would work for us what was that thing the big white thing with pants hanger now thats a storage solution or maybe a grill unclear so after rearranging the tracks and shelves inside these mirrored units and also actually removing the door on tylers closet for easy access purposes we place the drawers into their new locations joanie and kids design so this is now gonna be tylers entire wardrobe and your whole dressing system will be in this area together expanding sounds pretty good well youre youre losing that dresser over there but everything is now gonna be super functional for you over here so with tylers domain prepped and ready we took his file folded sweatpants shorts and undies and placed them nicely into their new homes yes the drawer porn was starting to take shape those are some beautifully file folded underwear will it ever look like this again every time other features in tylers new unit include one of those grill like pants hangers on top and a bougie new hamper system at the bottom its like a fancy trashcan following that we just had to hang all of his shirts in his new leaderless closet and to my great delight we also got all new matching hangers so it looks really sexy oh yeah thats what im talking about thats all my shirts yeah what i feel a lot of relief looking at this i feel like your closet was so stressful before it was stressful im actually kind of realizing that it was then time to move on to my stuff now my domain is still the closet for my tops and dresses my bottoms in this large cabinet my workout gear slash athleisure in this corner cabinet and my underwear pajamas and sweatpants in this chest of drawers that will also contain our communal pool of socks so we started with the pants cabinet oh it comes out nice out wow that is more than i thought it was where we were able to hang all of my jeans and lay out my much decreased collection of shorts well my shorts are just you know they need some space next up we put away all of my file folded yoga pants and sports bras and hung up all of my workout tops it was quite the flurry of action yeah im not sure what to grab next im like should i take that to the closet and once all the clothes were put away in their new areas it was time for the micro organizing or what i would call the professional touches so were gonna go in and were gonna make sure that everything is sorted by category and then were going to put in dividers that way its easy for you to find and also put things away and as some its just fun baskets yeah i just wondered just baskets  super baskets are always fun were gonna add baskets to contain some of the items that dont get hung in your closet like your winter hats and your ski socks and things like that and then were gonna leave a little bit of room for growth so if you get more things over time well have a little bit of empty basket space to grow into this was the time when the label maker was busted out we labeled a bunch of stuff now to make the most out of our drawers we added some cool slider dividers for my underthings as well as a couple mini baskets throughout for accessories joni and kit had also brought some springloaded dividers to address our sock situation we have like multiple drawers worth of socks right there are gonna be two large drawers for socks its a serious sock collection im so confused by that because i can never find socks so the fact that we have so many is confounding like i dont know you have done the history so with the help of our dividers some serious folding and a little bit of lastminute editing of the collection our communal sock drawer was born well there are two of them so twins and then finally as a finishing touch we filed away tylers orthopedic accessory collection okay so tyler actually didnt have anything in these bins because he had edited so much of his wardrobe down for me to grow but we did find a couple of plantar fasciitis like braces their foot stretchers yeah foot stretchers so i decided to make one of his bins tylers weird foot stuff and put those up there nothing weird about buying a fasciitis i guess thats true i darts i dont need to foot shame you and with our weird foot stuff accounted for organization day two was complete all right guys are we done oh my god oh my word i would say that like we took a lot of stuff out like look at these garbage bags you did you guys guys did a great job editing down to the things that you really know youre gonna be wearing do you think we kept too much i dont think joey might say yes i think you kept the perfect amount so that was a wrap on joanie kit and devon so organization a chick lets do it yeah yes yes that was three highfives in a row we didnt talk about that beforehand that was unplanned so to top off our closet redo we pushed tylers old bureau into the guest room and went out to get a couple of decorative items to spruce up the rest of our room just to make it feel a little less only functional and a little more fun oh and also we got a plant and with that our bedroom mini makeover was done so lets take a look at our new closet and bedroom situation starting with my walkin closet through the bathroom so in here we have all of my tops jackets tunics dresses and skirts all divided and labeled i feel like the setup is somewhat similar as in like most things are hanging still but the decreased quantity of clothes like definitely gives me more space to see stuff and i mean i feel like there are fewer clothes like that have fallen through the cracks of other clothes obviously we also have our fun baskets up here and then ive got an empty one for a little room for growth i dont know whats gonna go up there but its gonna be exciting when i figure out what will so next up for my stuff is this unit over here which is very different inside than it was before down here we have all of my pants and shorts and then in the middle we have a little surprise new jewelry display jodi and kit had noticed that i previously had some jewelry like hiding in my closet so we thought it would be a good idea to put it out here so i could actually see it and then up top we have a bunch of boxes for our toiletry cases other bags and things we have to take like to our office this cabinet here is also very different now ive got workout tops up here and then ive got sports bras fulllength yoga pants cropped yoga pants and gym shorts the rest of my clothes are now in our one shared dresser and in here ive got my decluttered bras my tights and spanx my undies right here ive got sweatpants and to finish off my clothes weve got my pjs as you can see the proud to be nerdy and a little flirty shirt did make it oh yeah and of course how could we forget about our communal sock drawers plural so i feel like thats a good transition to tyler stuff of which most of his bottoms are in here he has definitely seriously declutter his pants three pans left and besides that hes got his impressive box or collection and then under that weve got shorts joggers and sweatpants and more joggers and sweatpants and then down here of course we have his fancy hamper oh i love when the drawers catch themselves like at the end thats fancy and then to finish off the clothes weve got tylers closet over here which no longer has a door and in here hes basically just got all of his tops short sleeve longsleeve sweat shirts buttoned shirts and then like a couple jackets in the back besides all that we do have a few extra things that weve added to the room to make it more fun starting with my new hamper that practically perfect helped us find its a giant divided hamper on wheels which seems intense but i think its what i need besides that we also have some new wall hangings a new chair some fun throw pillows including this triangular one a new rug and our fiddle leaf fig plant its called a fiddle leaf fig not a fiddly fig i thought it was fiddly fig but its not it is also real so were gonna keep that being alive yes we are gonna water it when its supposed to be watered so all that is our new bedroom im really happy with how weve redone our closets because i feel like everything makes a lot more sense and in terms of the decor it might not be like a true mr kate makeover but you know we added some things here and there just to make it feel a little more homey also if you are wondering if im wearing the same thing that ive been wearing for days the answer is yes i wanted to wait to film this before i started taking clothes out of their places yes okay so that was getting our closets professionally organized im definitely very pleased with the final product of all of our work this week and it is actually a weight off of my shoulders to think about how much we ended up decluttering i mean we took bags and bags of stuff to be donated and as a final inventory not only did we greatly reduce the barnacle that was my wardrobe but we were also able to move an entire bureau out of our room and fit everything into our remaining furniture pieces with room to spare and it is also file folded to the heavens which is very sexy christine might be a hollow sexual but i think im a condo sexual now in terms of the professional organizer aspect of our closet makeover i would say that anyone could probably declutter on their own at home even though practically perfect traveling rod was very impressive but i found that there was a real benefit to having them reconfigure our closets and drawers and teach us how to display things differently so we can actually find more of our stuff i guess i could have figured out the file fold on my own but im not sure if i would have figured out how to optimize these giant mirrored thingies without their help i think after this experience now that the floodgates have been opened on the clothes in general next up im probably gonna want to declutter some of our prop clothing i kind of want to sort through it all and then have like a giant yard sale for it except for the wish stuff i wont charge anyone for that thank you guys so much for watching and once again a big thank you to practically

like this make sure to shamash that subscribe button here are my social media handles and a big shout out to arrests uh for watching thanks for watching or ésta and i will see you guys next time this is safiyas new intro song hello friends and welcome to another video today im gonna be buying four wedding dresses from wishcom now just as a refresher wish is a suspiciously low cost online market place where people sell pretty much anything from stretchy tongues to plastic tents to wedding dresses and both in their many advertisements online and also in their product listings the items they sell can look pretty good but often times after purchasing you do not end up receiving an item that looks like what you thought it would look like and i should know as ive previously bought inexpensive clothing free aka just pay shipping items knock off electronics and mostly fake makeup from wish before and though i would say that there was an item or two that i did like they mostly are of questionable quality now as some of you all might know i am engaged betrothed affianced and because im predictable and because you guys requested it i thought it was finally time to dive into wishs wedding dress pool i will say i have been curious about their wedding dresses for a long time because it seems like a very high stakes thing to buy on wish vs say a tshirt not to mention that the price differential between wishs listings at like  and the average cost of a wedding dress at like  is suspiciously huge so i figured we should order some and test them out to see whats up and while im probably not going to end up wearing any of these to my actual wedding i guess never say never also i do know of a couple other wish wedding dress videos so im going to list those down below and with that lets get to it okay so lets just type in wedding dress to the search bar now as i implied earlier this isnt my first time looking at the wedding dresses from wish so i do have sort of like four different categories in mind im interested in a big poofy ballgown dress which is like not necessarily the look im going for with my actual wedding dress but it seems like a difficult style to make so i just want to see what wish comes up with im also interested in a sort of like medieval or renaissancestyle dress because as we can see with like literally these first few results this style right here is just allover wish for some reason im also looking for a black wedding dress just to see what that would be like and also a slightly more expensive wedding dress i wonder if we spend like more than a  if well get something a little bit closer to like an actual wedding dress one might want to wear okay lets get started with the ballgown alright let me just start scrolling down oooh this one looks interesting its  but its sort of like a ballgown version of like a kate middleton wedding dress so im going to save that one as an option these ones are kind of cute that have the sort of like lace thing happening i dont know if thats like a true ballgown but im kind of into it i will say that its sort of hilarious to me how they photoshopped the different colours on in fact if you look in the back theyve just like edited out the top of the dress for some reason that must have been a mistake going back to our kate middleton option this dress right here is the  women wedding dress korean brief bride marriage one word shoulder repair trailing long sleeves dress plus size tyler what does one word mean safiya it was definetly not one word but going along with the name the dress does seem quite large and dramatic which i think is what im going for like i want some serious volume that i could hide people under nutcrackerstyle so i think we should get this one ohh actually as soon as i like put in my desired size and colour it says its going to be  instead of  which definitely puts it more in that like last category of the slightly more expensive wish dress so let me see if i cant find like a similar dress for just a little bit less this one sort of looks like that kate middletonstyle even though this one only has threequarter sleeves they also have a nice little infographic here showing you how pleased you will be with their price im actually pretty into this this one does not have any reviews though so i guess were just taking a leap of faith sort of like marriage i guess tyler hey saf  so im going to add that to the cart and that is our ballgown and then lets look for our medievalstyle wedding dress now theres pretty much like one photo that circulates around wish on different listings that is the style im thinking of and i actually see one right here so im going to save that though i did see one listing down here that was also a medieval dress but was a different style so im going to open this guy up as well and then we can compare them alright so this like original medievalstyle dress is  its got fourandahalf stars and its called the handfasting medieval wedding dress lotr renaissance fantasy gown solid batwing sleeve elegant medieval dress tyler wow that is like really up my alley just shoot right up it tyler one could say they had you at batwing most people do the reviews say that the fabric is thin which is to be expected i guess but people do seem to like it so thats promising this other one is kind of interesting though it is slightly less wellreviewed though at threeandahalf stars to me the reason i like it is because of this sort of like long cape sleeve i wouldnt call it a bat sleeve its kind of like a maleficent sleeve if you will it is a pretty cool dress but i see the other one everywhere so i feel like i have to try it out so im going to add that one to the cart now lets move on and see if we cant find a black wedding dress to try on so i think that might require like an actual search i didnt see a ton of black wedding dresses just on this wedding dress search page alright weve got some uh wedding dresses with like black accents ooh i completely missed the fact that theres just giant fake boobs as the number one search result for black wedding dress so thank you wish i guess this dress is actually really cute its definitely grey and not black but im just going to open that in a new tab just to see this is cool it is  but i kinda want to just look at it so lets open that up too okay i know i have a lot of options already but this is also a cool dress so now ill stop looking although that is cool too nope nope not going to do it this dress here i think is really pretty but looking at it it is only one size and though i dont know centimetres or kilograms im guessing i am going to be a bit big for it though i do think this photoshoot like on the rocks is pretty impressive and i like her crown this dress that i just clicked on is like totally like the kind of dress that i would wear in that its like partially black and then the rest of it is kind of tan but it is also over  which i kind of want to reserve for that last category so my eyes turn to this dress which at first i thought was only grey but it turns out that it is also available actually in black and its a pretty good looking dress so im going to add that one to the cart and that is our black wedding dress okay so now were onto our fourth and final dress category the slightly more expensive wish wedding dress so im going to return to like the normal wedding dress search page and see what we can find this ones pictures are quite pretty and its  so im going to open that in a new tab this one looks cool too and it looks like theres a giant train so lets open that up alright and im also going to open up this dress thats  its kind of like a peachy blush color this dress is very pretty to me and it has four out of five stars on sixteen reviews this girl says she is going to wear it on her wedding day so i think that she was pleased enough with the dress that it seems like shes going to do it this dress is also very pretty though i do like that she has like a kind of robe that goes over her dress this one has threeandahalf out of five stars which is okay but there is one kind of troubling review nia has really gone in and told you whats up its too small if you order your normal size its seethrough without any boning or structure to hold the top of the dress up and the dress is actually not a true champagne colour because its too yellowish i feel like after that im not sure we can get it i feel like nia just served us like a slice of truth pie and then this dress that i thought looked cute in pictures has one star on one review its still only one persons opinion but that doesnt bode well so im going to go with the longsleeved mermaidstyle dress there are a couple of red flags as there are with almost every wish listing mine here being that every picture on the side bar is the same photo that kind of looks like it was taken from someones instagram or something and i only say that because they like weirdly blurred this girls elbow but lets go with it and see what happens so with that we have all four of our wish wedding dresses so im going to order these right now and then hopefully in about a month and a half we can try them on so next time you see me ill have my haul alright so its been about a month and i believe i have all of my wish wedding dresses here now i did rip open the bags a little bit just to see what weve got to make sure weve got it all i ravaged them if you see some extra bags on the table i did order some backup sizes just in case the original sizes didnt fit i just didnt want to run into a situation where i couldnt even put on a dress so what i think we should do is just go through these one at a time try them on and see how they are and how they compare to what i thought i was going to get and i think we should do it in the order in which we bought them which i believe is ballgown first oh its very crinkly here i go im going to take this out of the bag congratulations its a lump it does kind of have like a vague chemicaly smell it kind of smells like acrylic paint oh no i think i just got lipstick on it excuse me thats no good so im guessing its folded up so im just going to unfold alright that looks like the skirt right this is skirt this is boobs its kind of an interesting fabric feel it sort of feels like a nice satiny shower curtain oh oh ty theres a brown stain over here  it doesnt necessarily look like an excrement stain it could be food coffee maybe like an iron burn why am i touching it  okay thats not ideal the only other thing i want to note before we like actually go and wear the dress is a little freebie that i got in my bag they gave me nail polish ring holders now im always down for a free little sumn but i feel like painting my nails is the last thing i would want to do in a wedding dress one can only hope so with that lets put this thing on okay so this is the ballgown on im having a lot of emotions right now for a variety of reasons first off this is the first wedding dress im ever trying on which is kind of fun and cool it is a giant tulle ballgown from wish which are none of the things i want for our actual wedding but thats fine thank you thats very sweet tyler so comparing how this dress looks on my body to the original photo on the listing i feel like it looks okay it looks probably more like the listing than i thought it would i mean just knowing wish a little bit now i am wearing a crinoline underneath this that i also bought on wish which seems to be doing a decent job of poofing i do kind of have room to hide people under there which is what i wanted with a ballgown you know we could just walk around have like other little pairs of feet underneath and then wapow  but there are also definitely some notsogood parts now the dress that i have on right now is actually the three xl size the one that we opened up was actually the l the one that had the uh mysterious brown stain inside of it but when i tried that one on it had a really hard time like getting over my shoulders and arms so we went with the  now though the larger size fits better its still tight around the shoulders and chest which is not something i often say because i dont have very large bazongas i have pretty like small to mediumsized bazongas small lets be real theyre small so i think its my chest barrel thats too big what that causes then is that the boob cavities that are sown into the dress are like sitting high on top of my boobs and my boobs are down here while were in the chestal region let me draw your attention to this pin thats still in the dress so we avoided the brown stain in this one but theres like literally a sewing pin thats been left in the left boob besides that there are also some other questionable things about the detailing like for example right down here you can kind of see the hot glue that theyve used to like glue this lace down and i think that because its all glued on some of the appliques are already coming off yeah kind of creates like a peeling effect sort of like im molting from my old life as a single lady into my new life like im a giant bird or snake yeah mayb no im thinking bird so all in all this one doesnt look so bad from far away but there are enough problems with it that i would not recommend this dress or wear it to my own wedding alright so next up is the medieval dress now i feel like normally im not gonna really like harp on the second option like the backup size unless i like really need to wear it but after peeping in on these two i did notice for some reason this one is straightup purple so not only did i buy a backup size i also bought a backup shade heres the thing  is that this is kind of funny to me but if i bought this dress wanting it to be a white dress for my wedding and i got a purple dress i would be pissed but regardless im just going to open up this white dress and see what it looks like outside of the bag alright here we go theres a lot of of skirt here i kind of like petting it it feels very nice it is kind of like a juicy couture renaissance wedding dress from wish i think these are the money sleeves though the batwing that drew me to this dress now what i will say is that i am kind of interested in like what this dress looks like because it is sort of close to a style of like actual wedding dress that i kind of want to wear to my actual wedding so im excited to see what it looks like on i mean listen i got a fever and the only cure is more bell sleeve sleeve bell cow sleeve tyler i got it saf alright so this is the renaissance dress the medieval dress the guinevere the galadriel now just so everyone knows i am currently wearing the smaller lightpurple dress we tried on the true white ivory dress and it was just too big in like the shoulder area so we have to go with the smaller one so compared to the photo in the listing i would say that this dress looks decently similar if just a little less majestic like her dress is a little more voluminous and structured while mine is a little flaccid on the positive side i am very comfortable im just feeling kind of like im wearing a nightgown the other things that i really like are the sleeves its just do your sleeves hang low do they wobble to and fro can you tie them in a knot could you tie them in a bow and the answer is yes to all of the above hoo hoo  are you noticing small particles going through the air while im doing that thats no good i have mange besides the fact that the fabric might be shedding the fit also leaves something to be desired overall its like a little shapeless like theres no sort of like support or structure in the bodice at all and it does also read a little more halloween than like a funthemed wedding like if you bought a galadriel costume from a bag it might be like this this might be it so all of that said i would definitely not wear this to a wedding but i might wear this if my bachelorette party were at medieval times now when were talking about this dress as like a standin for a general style though im into it this dress might not have been exactly what i wanted but im still a sucker for a good batwing cant stop wont stop flapping alright so next up is our black wedding dress oooh alright im liking this look already its got some nice sort of like creeping black lace you know almost like a vine almost like a vine let me unfold it a little bit the belt im not a super big fan of its kind of just like a random satinlooking ribbon but besides that i do kind of like the look of this thing although it does seem like these boob cups are kind of falling out looks like a flying saucer now im pretty torn on the idea of a black wedding dress i feel like its kind of a meme like people keep tweeting me like commenting on videos oh your wedding dress better be black and im open to the idea but im not like definitely going to get a black dress i mean the thing that ive been thinking about is like maybe having like a black reception dress or something so its kind of like a white swan black swan moment but as for like a fullon black wedding dress all day i dont know i guess this will be sort of like a toeintothewater of a black wedding dress so lets go try it on okay so this is the black dress on now i would say that this dress is kind of residing in the uncanny valley for me its not horrible but its not awesome i think that in the photos on wish the waist of the dress seemed a bit lower and on me its kind of hitting like right under the boobs a little bit higher than my natural waist so i kind of feel like its sort of like a little girls dress where they just hit you at the ribcage because you dont really have a waist yet now this is the l size the other dress that we have is smaller so i dont think that would help like the sort of proportion problem im having right now and regardless even this bigger size is a little short on me this might be a dress thats made for more petite ladies someone like this tall i think that the work on this dress is definitely like a little bit messy but it is sewn on rather than glued on which at this point is a win so i think that it is a little bit nicer in that regard but it just doesnt seem like a wedding dress to me and not just because of the color i dont feel like theres anything about this dress thats making me feel like im the center of attention like in the listing on wish the dress had more of a train the fabrics seemed more flowy and the look was more like ethereal but in person the dress is more just like stiff tulle so as for this dress in general i wouldnt recommend it for a wedding and i would not wear it at my wedding if i were gonna wear a black dress to my wedding id want to be slinky what if i wore the zozo suit to our reception  alright and then here we have our exshpenshive dress i keep saying exshpenshive i mean expensive now this quite a voluminous package uh thats its girdle its got to stay sucked in alright shall i pull one out boom oh i see some lace this is a wedding dress alright its coming out of the bag ooh it smells almost identical to the ballgown oh yeah its got like a super painty kind of smell alright here im going to unroll it a little bit oh shes tall look at that look at the train theres some fabric back there now because this was our more expensive dress i do have like slightly higher expectations for it and there are some things that seem like a little bit nicer about it than the other dresses but im going to reserve like my full judgement until i try it on so lets go do that okay so this is my fancy shmancy dress on i will say that now that its on my body the smell is still there  its kind of like a plasticy fishy smell its odd the other thing is that theres a lot of dirt on the dress or like small amounts of sort of like dirt particles and a hair as well as a small rustcoloured stain so it kind of feels like it came a little dirty and not like sexy dirty like literally dirty as for the appearance of the actual dress i think that this dress looks reasonably like the photo its not like a complete like oh my god i didnt order that but some of the details just look kind of worse on this dress than in the picture and it definitely doesnt fit me right this one is the larger of the two sizes that i ordered and im wearing this one because the other one could not get over my thighs and booty at all  it was rump rejected but even though the bottom of this one fits a lot better the top of this dress is quite loose theres just a lot of room up here theres room for two just this i guess you know if this were going to be my actual wedding dress i could go get it tailored uptop a little bit i mean thats what people do with wedding dresses they get they get them altered that being said though i do kind of like the idea of the mermaid fit like im feeling kinda like a little ooh bring it around town dont dig too deep into that one just leave that where it is the other thing that i do like about it is the length of the train back here this is something that we have not really seen with any of the other dresses  whether it be dusty or not it does exist so overall even with a couple of better elements than the other dresses i still wouldnt say this dress is good in fact its probably the least comfortable the fabric is a tiny bit itchy but more than anything its just warm i think this is like the tightest dress to the body that ive tried on so far and i dont think the fabric is breathing super well so my legs and thighs are sweating ohh its happening i am in a fancy white duffle bag okay so now that we have all these wedding dresses in our possession and ive tried them on and figured out which ones actually sort of fit me lets take them out into the world and do a little wedding montage because every wedding dress deserves their day in the sun no matter how strange they smell tyler well youre wearing a wedding dress tyler good save   im crying not from joy but from wind  is my eyeliner okay okay so those were my four wish wedding gowns now overall i had a good time trying on my first set of wedding dresses and i did enjoy gallivanting about with them at the beach but besides that i wouldnt say that i had a very positive impression of these dresses to be fair they all ended up looking somewhat like the original pictures but i would say that none of them lived up to what was really presented in the listings as all of them had some problems with fit and also most of the details were pretty iffy ranging from questionable stains to saggy zippers to dangerous pins now i will say that i didnt enter this experiment expecting to find my dream wedding dress and i think that most people who requested this video were more interested in seeing what on earth wish would send us rather than like a serious wedding dress tryon but in general in case you were wondering i would not recommend buying a dress from wish for your or anyone elses wedding i mean when it comes to wish you basically dont know what youre going to get in any scenario and with the stakes of a wedding you probably dont want to play russian roulette with what youre going to wear if you are a bride on a budget looking for an inexpensive wedding dress i would say you should go for pretty much any other option ideally one that you can try on and smell in person because even if wish wedding dresses seem cheap you might end up wasting your money buying backup sizes or buying a dress you dont even end up liking when it arrives i guess its possible that some people find wedding dresses on wish that they like but from my experience buying stuff from there that would be the exception and not the rule as for whether or not they are suitable for a rocques renaissance bachelorette party though i guess ive never been to the excalibur hotel in vegas before so ladies saddle up

social media handles and a big shoutout to tabitha for watching thanks for watching tabitha and i will see you guys anext time  tyler  oh my god saf alright do it again hello friends and welcome to another video today im gonna be ordering and trying out custom clothing from an app so a few weeks ago i saw this video on twitter proclaiming the benefits of the zozo suit which from the looks of it is essentially like a motion capture unitard that is designed to help that exact measurement of your body and the way its supposed to work is you don the suit take photos of yourself in said suit upload them to their app they analyze the pics and then you can order custom clothing from them based on their reading thats right future fuutuuureeee now this suit was designed by a japanese ecommerce site as a way to help online shop which actually seems like a pretty useful idea however having tried some of these types of futuristic products in the past they often sound a lot cooler than they actually are or they dont end up working very well so were going to throw this thing on take some pics upload them to the app order some custom clothes and see how they actually fit alright lets do it so here is my zozo suit in its zozo bag as you can see on the front it shows you sort of like the gist of the thing you wear the suit and the app measures you and then you become dan stevens in beauty and the beast on the front it also says thank you for joining the zozo revolution for a sizefree world i mean it sounds exciting absolutely you know were doing away with the guillotine and were bringing out the suits okay so lets open this up and see whats inside ooohhh alright so inside it seems i have my zozo suit and a card of instructions in english and german apparently not so lets open this guy up too huh let me at the zozo so first impression is that it feels kind of like really thin under armour but with seemingly like braille characters on them or like unknown pokémon that one kinda looks like the dipper if you ignore those two and uh this ones mars  alright so it seems like the zozo suit consists of a longsleeved turtleneck and some matching leggings its two pieces but they come together as one to measure your body hug your curves and send that information to japan just wait til i put it on and you get my booty measurements im clenching my booty i dont know if you can tell  alright lets move on im a legitimate reviewer of the zozo suit alright so in the instructions the first step is to put my suit on and then just set up our phone on this phone stand that theyve given us so with that done lets put on the suit alright tyler are you ready for my polkadotted jelly tyler woooo i feel like im performing in the musical cats tyler  yes my precioussss
tyler  and then heres dan stevens ready oh emma watson youre so beautiful heres the thing  i would totally rock this shirt as like a shirt for real because i love fingerless attached gloves big fan also i think its funny to see where the dots are stretched out on me because its really the thigh were all good over here over here over here but then wham bam thank you maam the fabric on my thigh is seethrough and the dots have been stretched a fair distance apart i feel very futuristic sort of gattaca sort of theatre kickball change kickball change hello my baby hello my darling hello my ragtime gal send me a kiss by wiiiire baby my hearts on fire bye alright i think ive had my fun lets go turn on the app okay so we have the suit on and weve already set up our phone stand so the next thing to do is to begin measuring with my zozo app alright so lets click the measure icon and first off i have to enter my height and weight and then after that were onto the measurement tutorial so it says to please make sure you are in a welllit room and then to place your phone eight inches from the edge of a table and to make sure that table is thirty inches tall lucky for us this table is approximately twentynine and a half inches tall perfect for zozo suit measuring you also have to make sure you stand about six feet away from the table and by measuring using my own body we deduced that this is about six feet away from the wall they will then begin photographing me in my current position okay so i have to make sure im wearing the zozo suit correctly this is true otherwise they would just record a large lump on my back that means the audio is about to get worse the thumb is through the hole yes the heel is in the hole too is my collar flat i believe so alright zozo would like access to my camera i should probably turn on my speaker so lets do this its siris evil cousin back again zozo zozo do you copy alright cool i think shes loud enough right okay okay good i feel like i am being tested whats happening app we will proceed with voice instructions turn your phone so the backside is facing towards you set it in the stand on a flat surface saf okay i will do whatever you say app wait for the next audio prompt app stand with your feet shoulderwidth apart and your arms down alongside your body leave enough space so there is some separation saf okay sorry app we will begin the measurement process standing in the  oclock position followed by clockwise movement until you have turned  degrees saf yes saf okay app well take your photo now saf okay app nine oclock position app  oclock position app youre done saf shall i lift my phone up siri is that okay siri are you angry with me did i do a good job please let me know ok so now that i have my measurements and ive been thoroughly dressed down by the evil cousin of siri lets order some custom clothes i mean this is the future being bossed around by polite yet passiveaggressive robots robotic voice get in loser were going shopping alright so its suggesting to me like a handful of clothing items i have a merino crew a scoop neck longsleeve a vneck tshirt some skinny jeans a boat neck tshirt a fitted vneck tshirt and a stripe longsleeve crew and also a stripe crew tshirt so no like dresses or rompers or really any fitting challenges besides perhaps the jeans so lets just order like a speckling of these items we should definitely get the skinny jeans because thats our only bottom option ooh and once i add it to the bag it allows me to adjust my measurements if i want to but im just going to go with the recommended fit just go with what the suit said app in more ways than one so besides that im going to pick up the fitted vneck tshirt just because it says its supposed to be more fitted so the measurements are more important the boat neck tshirt because i would like one of those and the mareno crew because it seems to be made out of a different fabric than the other two mareno i think is what its made of okay so my items have been ordered and it says that theyre going to take about a month to get here so once they do arrive so well see how well zozo did measuring my bahdy in the meantime ill be wearing this okay so its about two months later and weve finally received our zozo package now i ordered this on november 9  and it said that it would take about 4 to 5 weeks to arrive and it arrived last week so it took about twice as long as it said it would but it has arrived so were going to open this and uh see whats inside and try it on ooooh presents that i paid for myself okay so we have my jeans tshirt sweater and boatneck shirt on all of the packaging they do have this little label down here which says sz which im assuming means size and then like a qr code so i wonder if theyve categorised my measurements in this qr code and then like generated all the clothes from that kind of like snapchat but for my booty alright so um i think that we should try them on now so im going to wear the jeans with like all of my tshirts because i only have one pair of jeans and this isnt that kind of video a porn video alright lets do it okay so this is my black boatneck top and my blue jeans right off the bat there are a few problems with the fit that ive noticed i feel wrinkly so with the pants specifically im noticing like a fair amount of extra fabric around the crotch its got give somethings gotta give and its the crotch the jeans are pretty stretchy in general but i do think that there is a little bit of extra room in like the back waistband speaking of the behind theres a lot of extra fabric right below the buttocks oh yeah like right here im feeling something it does as i sort of move around give me a bit of a diaper feel which is not what you want with skinny jeans to top it all off i kind of think that the pant legs  as well as the sleeves of the top  are a bit short i think there is some plausible deniability that maybe ive been working out more in january than i was in november and december which are usually my most bootylicious months but i dont think ive grown any taller since then so i think they mightve mismeasured my limbs besides that i think that the shirt is okay however in general i would say that this combo isnt doing it for me but lets try on the other two shirts and see how they are alright so this is my grey sweater so having tried on this second top i feel like im not having an issue with how the tops are fitting and i will say that the sleeves on this one are long enough to the point where like theyre hitting the bottom of my hands so im not really sure what was wrong with the sleeves on the other shirt now what i will say about the sweater is that it does seem like sort of a missed opportunity to like get my custom measurements and then give me kind of like a boxy sweater like i feel it would be cool if it was a tighttothebody sexy sweater or something more in that vein yeah because its like okay yeah it fits but its not a revelation that it fits but lets try on our last item okay and this is my final top  the plain white tee did birks just spontaneously appear on my feet that ones gone forever  that was an expensive move now what i will say about this shirt is that the fabric seems nice and it is like comfortable on my body as in its soft but im not really seeing any like customfit in fact i would say this probably fits me the same or worse than my current tshirts do i think it is like a little tighter to my body than the black tshirt and the grey sweater but its still not doing a lot for me i dont feel like cupped hugged i dont even feel skimmed i mean i feel like when you hear custom clothing you either think like the design is custom or the fit is custom so it like fits you like a glove and with this outfitall of these clothes neither is the case so now that weve tried out all the clothes and seen how they fit and how they look i was thinking we should try the zozo suit on one more time not just because i like wearing the zozo suit and then see if i am measuring any differently now than i did back in november to see if maybe thats the problem okay so im back in the suit back at it again in the zozo suit  oops now one thing i will say having it on like sort of right where my hand starts hence why my jeans may be a little short alright so im going to bring back and let her measure me one more time and see where we stand so im going to go for a new measurement i think that im identifying that for sure which seems like a zozo suit nono but it also seems like they want both app youre done the measurement process is complete see the results on your phone saf awesome okay great so that was uh measuring part 2 how do i now see if theres any difference from the last time i was measured now just to like triplecheck everything i probably should have done this when we first measured myself im gonna be honest and say i dont think all of the measurements are spoton i would say that like my measurement of my hips seems to be onpoint with what theyre saying but my chest and my upper waist seems to be a little smaller with the measuring tape than on the app i mean i think the technology is pretty cool like theres not a lot of safeguards if you dont do it exactly right okay so that was a lot of the zozo suit and proportionately not that much of the custom clothing now although i thoroughly enjoy jiggling around in a polkadotted spandex suit for a while im not sure that the final custom clothes were really worth the time and effort im not sure based on our few different measurements how accurate this thing really is in fact i think its a little inaccurate and in terms of the clothes that we received i feel like the items themselves were pretty standard and the fit was pretty medium besides that i was also kind of disappointed in the clothing pieces that they offered i feel like none of them except for the jeans would really ever require being custom fitted like if theyre going to gather all this information about our bodies shouldnt they be trying to make clothes that reflect that like a prom dress or like the perfect fitted blazer like anything that would normally be tailored  i think thats what i would want not a white tshirt now i feel like its only fair to say that they are just starting out with this technology so hopefully in the future it will get more precise and the clothing offerings will become more robust but for now i dont think theyve really nailed it on the bright side though i do now have a zozo suit that i can wear wherever i want we might not be living in the future just yet but i might be living in a production of the cats the musical thank you guys so much for watching also i just wanted to let you guys know that we do have some new merch we have here our new fiendish behavior hoodie as well as our fiendish behavior longsleeved shirt theyre supposed to kind of build off the whole mischief afoot theme we have going on and i feel like theyre perfect if you wanna let people know ahead of time that you wreak a small amount of havoc wherever you go so if you wanna check these guys out the link will be in the description below aww that rhymed wow if you liked that video make sure to shmash that like button and if you want to see more videos like this make sure to shmash that subscribe button here are my social media handles and a big shoutout to glassescat for watching thanks for watching glassescat and i will see you guys anext time hello friends and welcome to another video today im gonna be building myself an athome spa from items ordered from amazon what does this mean i am not sure but my goal is to be relaxed and to not electrocute myself so a few weeks ago one of you guys tweeted me a picture of an inflatable jacuzzi and i thought i want that and while pursuing that jacuzzi on amazoncom i found a whole host of other athome spa products and not really just products more like machines specifically ones that let you simulate spa experiences by yourself like this selfmassager not vibrator this scrubbing footbath and this oneperson sauna so i figured lets order five of these products and test them out to see how they are and also to see if we can truly create a oneperson athome spa because why go to the spa when you can order things from amazon alright lets see what we can find okay so im gonna open up amazoncom now the categories of machines that i want are like a facial steamer a footbath a selfmassager an inflatable jacuzzi  and a sauna which i think all together will represent like a headtotoe spa treatment and also those seem to be the machines that are available so im gonna start with the facesteamer so there are a couple of sponsored links up top the first one does look kinda good but i know theyve payed to be there oh this one sounds kinda funky its called the  is this a wish video its like wish is spreading that one does have four stars on  reviews though there is one right above it that says its amazons choice and one right below it thats the one that i sort of wanted from the beginning that was in the sponsored link that kind of looks like a fancy trash can the beauty nymph one has like a pretty clear like facial entrance you know what i mean like i can visualize my face in the orifice the amazons choice one is a little bit more of like a steam that ejects itself onto you like it seems like you sort of keep your face a little further away and just hover near it and the fancy trash can one also seems to have a sort of similar design even though that seems like maybe more work than i wanna do during my athome spa day it does seem like in the beauty nymph face steamer reviews people mention that it doesnt produce a lot of steam and in the video for the fancy trash can it seems like there is steam a plenty yeah they call it dense and abundant warm mist so because of the volume of steam in this video im going with fancy trash can and that will be item number one alright so next up lets go for the foot bath there are a few different kinds of foot baths on amazon i am very interested in like these types of ones that have like a rolling that have a rolling scrubber on the bottom thatll really get your feet for you kind of like this one that says best choice but that looks like theyre just trying to simulate that they are amazons choice but they are not it also looks like its on rollers which i dont think i need but actually that seems to be like a pretty common feature cause this one also has rollers it looks like you can remote control it around am i wrong lets see whats going on here im gonna keep this one in another tab alright so im seeing a lot of these guys that look pretty similar but this one looks interesting because there are three rolling like foot massagers and its also on wheels itself so you have actually five pairs of wheels involved it seems like it has most of the stuff that i want like massagers that will roll your feet oxygen bubbles a little warmth what else do you really need so now im in between essentially two ones that are both on rollers and both have like massaging foot beds this one thats like very expensive that was the best choice one definitely has a lot of bells and whistles but im not sure that this is the place to splurge as the jacuzzis and the saunas seem to be kind of pricey so i think im gonna go with the yosager foot spa bath massager not only because its cheaper but because it has so many sets of wheels it seems like it could really rub your feet raw which is kind of what i need honestly my feet are very callased and bumpy and so that is our foot spa bath massager on wheels so next up were looking for a massager now the massagers that i saw that i thought were like a little bit of like a stepup from just a sort of samantha from sex and the city sharper image like one coloumn massager hello friends and welcome to another video  today im gonna be investigating and trying asmr for the first time  ive hit the mic one quick thing before we get started though i know there are some people out there who know what asmr is and do not enjoy the whispering sounds thats torture in some countries so for all of you who are in that boat the first half of this video will be full voiced and will have not that many asmr sounds but for people in the other camp who are here only for the asmr oh my god bitch im turning this up this is the timestamp that you can head to right now to watch and hear my attempt at an asmr video  it smells a little questionable right here okay so now that is out of the way lets talk about what asmr is just in case youve seen these letters floating around and dont know asmr stands for autonomous sensory meridian response which refers to the tingly and relaxing response that people can have to certain triggers this feeling can range from a staticky or warm feeling in the back of your head to a chilly or goosebumpy feeling you can get when someone does that egg cracking thing on you put a knife in your back and the blood is gushing down im sleeping with pams mom sometimes dinner and essentially asmr videos on youtube are trying to do to you what dwight is doing to michael here just with audio and visual triggers through the screen hey boss you seem tense triggers like whispering tapping breathing chewing painting etc usually noices that are quiet and repetitive and some people experience these tingels and some people dont now im sure most of you have seen atleast one asmr video around youtube before as it has been sort of moving into the mainstream recently with many nonasmr youtubers making asmr videos in the last few months ookurrrrrrt ookurrrrt now im actually a frequent viewer of asmr i discovered the term back in  when i was looking through backstagecom  where there was a casting call for a youtube channel called quiet cat asmr in which they were looking for a woman to dress up as a cat and pretend to do cat things like scratch a scratching post meow and purr softly i did not choose to audition for this but i searched up asmr on youtube clicked on a asmr makeup collection vanity tour and the rest is history now i use asmr videos as kind of like a advanced white noice machine i do get the tingles but thats not always the primary reason why i watch i like to play them in the backround when im doing busy work or writing a script for a video or winding down to go to bed that being said i definitely dont know everything about asmr and i really dont know how to make an asmr video besides the obvious like tap on things and dont scream but i am very interested in trying it out so to help me in my quest i decided to seek out the advice of a real asmr youtuber who could show me the ropes and then try and make an asmr video of my own okay lets do it so this is gibi also known as gibi asmr as you can tell by her finger fluttering that she was just performing  so gibi started her asmr channel back in  and she has over  million subscribers and over  videos which range from general trigger compilations to more intricate role playing videos hello everybody its gibi if you can see me under all this hair gibi thank you for coming  i have a lot of questions that i have written down on my phone im ready to answer them great amazing alright lets just jump right in shall we so gibi discovered asmr in  back when the community was still in its early stages i was watching like a massage video like stumbled into that realm and someone in the comments was talking about asmr i ended up googling the term and it had its own wikipedia page and i was like oh my god like ive experienced this my whole life like as a little kid i remember feeling like the asmr tingles that they were talking about and i didnt know that it had a name i didnt know anyone else felt that so i started looking up asmr videos and way back in the day it was actually called the whisper community and i literally have not stopped watching them since like everynight now asmr as a feeling may actually have ancient origins its not  proven but some people hypothesize that asmr could be evolutionary related to bonding behaviors like grooming nonetheless talking about asmr is definitely new people cite that it was first openly discussed online in  in a thread on steadyhealthcom titled weird sensation feels good and from there forums were created whispering videos were produced and the term asmr was coined and while at first it was definitely classified as a weird sensation that feels good since about sh people have been talking about it in the public sphere more and more i have this thing thats a very real response its called asmr with w magazine launching their celebrities try asmr series hello im jake asmr gyllenhaal and brands like lush and ikea using asmr in their sponsorships and advertisements  its been very quickly a thing that none of us used to talk about it at all its kind of embarrassing you know cause you are like i dont know how to explain this so im just gonna not but now kids know about it it was on jimmy fallon or jimmy kimmel shoot i dont remember which one one of the jimmys so asmr and this is its supposed to do what now one of my theories as to why asmr has become more mainstream recently is the huge popularity of oddly satisfying videos like slime mixing kinetic sand cutting and just like generally squishing stuff  pop blop pop   squish   wet crunch  and although these videos are not all necessarily asmr they are kind of like gateway asmr  cruuuuuunnchhhhhh    take it out squeeze it out oh its gonna come out yeahh yeeahhhhhh i love asmr videos so that kinda like same kinda feeling regardless of how its become so popular though with the attention has come a lot of opinions what misconseptions do people have about asmr that frustrate you as an asmrtist mhm theres two the first one is that people say its a fad and i just have to point them to the fact that like its been on youttube for 8 years you know people are falling asleep to asmr every night and then the other thing people usually assume off hand that its sexual  is it sexual     i mean it no  what youre saying sounds sexual to me they see something that you know is weird or whatever they just like brush it off as thats definitely a sex thing admittedly the case for asmr is not a sex thing isnt helped by the fact that when it was first described online it was consistently referred to as a brain orgasm but according to a recent study less than  of participants reported feeling aroused after watching asmr videos to be fair asmr can be intimate though in a different way as some people link asmr feelings to caring and nurturing triggers that are often experienced in infancy with the idea that asmr is kind of like what a baby feels when its being soothed by its parent or what a cat feels when its being pet adorable purring im sure freud would have a field day with that but i think its supposed to be like an instinctual feeling of being cared for are you interested in like the science behind it at all like are you interested in like doing science  yes overall asmr science is still in its early stages a lot of recent studies are just out to prove that its real and what biologically is happening when you experience it but a lot of people note that they actively use asmr as a way to treat their stress anxiety and insomnia  there was a study  the university of sheffield played my videos and another artist and another artists called whispersred they played our videos to people and they studied their brains they definitely saw a real physical response and a real sensation  so people who experience this feeling arent just making it up its a real response  it truly helps our cause like if people are like this is just a fad this is weird this is xyz its really nice to be able to point to studies so the more people that do it  like were very excited about anything that comes up  okay so now that weve covered a lot about asmr as a sensation i wanted to talk about how to make asmr content as i still have to do that so like what would you consider to be good asmr if that makes sense  yes its kind of like a trick question i would say because everybody has different triggers you know some peoples favorite asmr creators are just somebody with apple headphones just doing it with their iphone in a dim room you know so it really depends on whos watching and what theyre looking for  now there are a lot of asmrtists out there who do a variety of different things talking videos no talking videos hands only videos animated videos in fact there are currently over  million asmr videos on youtube of people trying different things as there seems pretty much any sound can be a trigger as long as its soft slow and repetitive soft slow and repetitive sounds as for the triggers were going to do im probably going to lean towards sounds that i like personally i dont like a lot of super intense like mouth sounds or like licking like that stuff im not super into hair cutting is okay scalp massaging is okay i love hair brushing soft slow repetitive hair brushing
ok finger fluttering im down with but i really like the slower sounds kind of like this kind of sound i like a lot yeah exactly paper sounds like book sounds are good paper sounds  i sort of think of it like its definitely like dry sounds versus wet sounds like you definitely prefer dry sounds  dry sounds
 you know what i mean
 mmhm  its so polarizing people will like  the eating sounds licking or anything like  people are very against or for  yeah no i think im  i think im dry next we have to figure out how to present the triggers now even though there are a ton of different asmr videos i would say that most of them fall into three rough buckets first off you have just like a straight up trigger compilation with no conceit like a ten triggers to help you fall asleep or a tapping on  different items sort of thing the second bucket contains videos that have a little more artifice the asmrtist sets up a specific scenario or activity that contains tingly or triggering instances like doing a makeup collection or haul coloring in a coloring book or giving someone a head massage an organic yet unintentional example of this is bob rosss painting tutorials where all hes doing is painting on a canvas on screen but it has all the ingredients to trigger asmr good brush sounds relaxing visuals and a chilledout presence brush sounds from the chilledout presence the third bucket is what i would call an immersive story or roleplay where the asmrtist sets up a scenario where they can perform actions on the camera as if it were you the viewer like giving you a spa treatment or giving you a haircut   i personally like roleplays thats why i think i tend to do more of that like i do what i like most of the time  this category also often includes the asmrtist pretending to be a different character coincidentally people love to do roleplays as bob ross sometimes where you are the canvas now i think that bucket number is probably the best one to try and make as a beginner but i am interested in trying out a roleplay segment because they seem kind of fun and people can get pretty creative with them ive previously mentioned one of my favorites the  ad you have the plague nun roleplay no its okay i can drink holy water im a nun those ones are hard to put in the background though because theres a lot happening like theres a lot going on and youre like what is that noise and its a rosary shes like swinging around and youre like why is this happening so after learning a little bit about how we could present our triggers i wanted to know more about the movie magic that goes into  asmr i think with some asmr you can mostly tell how theyre produced and you can see how the person is making the sounds but with other videos its not quite as clear especially with roleplay videos where things are kind of happening around the camera like do you ever like put things on your camerawigs or googly eyes  i dont know something that would help you but would also like simulate the sound for the audience yeah ive done that before wheneverif youre doing any sort of hair brushing or hair cutting like i will stick a wig on the camera you know like because youre correct that you have to look in the camera like youre talking to the camera like im talking to you right now i remember doing like a dentist roleplay and i sort of like messed up in doing the mouth around the top and bottom of the lens and people were like youre cleaning my eyes you know so now in terms of audio gibi mentioned that she tries to make all of the sounds naturally from their source but there are some hacks that shes found  when i do head message videos now i have a wig inside of a mesh bag it gives more of an intense scratching sound than just touching like a wig on top of the camera might for any sort of skin i will either use this leather sort of like jug that i have its just  a leather jug
 ill have to show you i brought it rags work really well for skin when i did a shaving roleplay i was doing a razor with shaving cream on a rag and just sort of like on the rag you know so you just sort of like test things out before you start filming what about like wet stuff like when youre trying to simulate like washing a face  its kind of experimental ive definitely a lot of times just put my hand up near the camera and just wiped on my hand but you have to make sure that your shoulder is down so that it looks okay to the viewer cuz you dont want to put a wet towel on the camera no no thats bad ive done that before it was not great ive sprayed cameras ive sprayed mics ive ruined two youve ruined two mics  ive ruined two mics
 how i wanted a more intense spray sound  straight down the middle
 i really just went for it and the next day my mic didnt work and i was likethat was probably my fault so i think the answer for us for now is probably to leave the water alone i am going for drier sounds anyway alright so with that um lets set up now gibi had brought a bunch of equipment for us to use so we could simulate her setup that she has at home she usually films standing up with like a table of props next to her but she uses a variety of microphones depending on what shes filming so we have the o which is the ears that you see right there hes got attached earlobes which i believe is a recessive trait i dont if thats relevant to anyone out there
 its interesting actually
 its science and then we have that guy down there which is the blue yeti
yeah and then these guys are like the road mics the ones im subtly groping shes got a lot
 i wanted to give you options for my first go i wasnt quite ready for the ears but i wanted to use something more advanced than the yeti so we went with the two standing road mics gibi also brought us a suitcase full of asmr props as well as costume pieces she uses for roleplays do i look good as an elf it kind of works with your haircut really it really suits you oh thats pretty good i decide not to go with the elf vibe but i did pick out a few of gibis props to tap on as well as some of my own props from our old videos that seemed like they had asmr potential whisper oh yeahhh it is actually to top it off gibi also gave me an old choppable wig for the roleplay segment  you can go to town on this this is a trash wig ok so welcome to the asmr portion of this video if you are not into asmr you can now not watch and i wont be offended but if youre only here for the asmr welcome was that too close im sorry so we have like a decent amount of triggers that gibi has brought for us that are like common triggers that asmr channels use um so im gonna start with some of those and then im gonna go for um some triggers that you may remember if youve watched any of our other vides okay ive got a short and stout brush and a sort of like long and skinny brush its kind of like a timon and pumbaa situation maybe i can  uh brush the top with this was that too much i guess you guys will tell me later i nudged something on the table next to me ignore that theres nothing there so that was brushing alright so next up ive got a cork piece of toast a coast a coast a toaster coaster this one is very popular on gibis channel so i thought id give it a try gibi do you like kinda like you scratch it a lot right oh go to town she says she says to go to town i was gonna say this is the kind of sound that i like like that kind of sound you know what i mean you could also like scratch it or like i guess tap it im not a huge onlytapping fan i prefer stroking hehehe it smells kind of good it smells like wood alright toaster coaster done so next up i have something that i feel like im gonna be pretty careful with the clear plastic pants so i feel like you could stroke it morphe palette which came out after i made the frankenguru eye shadow palette video so unfortunately it was not included but i felt like we could scrape it a little bit today yeah see look im unleashing my inner asmrtist mindblown mindblown and by mind i mean your mind see this is like the kind of sound that i really like kinda like pencil on paper sounds okay im gonna open it now alright so um im going to scrape it with my eyeshadow scalpel just a little here im gonna hold it like a violin like right under my chin its quiet were gonna have to turn that up there you go oh yeah the thing is since i have to hold it like this i can only scrape in that ear okay i think that this palette got sister scraped so i can put it away lets move on to the final portion of the asmr which is the role play thats right folks itll be sort of a self aware roleplay but were gonna do it so ah gibi has gifted me this ah trash wig as she calls it so im allowed to do whatever i want with this wig so what i though is that we would just recreate the scenerio from my hair cutting tutorial video but its just me cutting someone elses hair without a tutorial uh ah yes and by someone else i mean you you you lucky dog you so i have very little equipment besides snip some scissors and a hairbrush but i figure thats all we need to get you a kickass bob alright so im going to brush her hair first oooo this wigs pretty soft for a trash wig sorry the other side of your hair is hard to brush because thats where the view finder is but i can just sort of like carry this side over or brush your bang softly oh there we go oh your hair is naughty ya look nice um yep youre looking good everythings great you do need a trim though more than a trim id say complete style change  ahahhahah dont worry this is relaxing its relaxing oh here lemme grab some of this oh yeaaaahh thats pretty good okay so now that all the knots are out of your hair its time for a friendly another ssnip im gonna go for that side first and im gonna cut it like this length okay we can be matching oo itll be great everythings okay ah yep oh yeah oh yeh look at thaaaat thats what im talking about youre bald  snipysnip alright so im gonna cut the rest of your hair on this side too yeeee oh yeeah there we go oh is looking good honestly thats probably more even than when i tried to cut it on myself so its all good thats someones stomach theres a lot of people in this room or it could be yours oh yeah okay there we go were getting somewhere im gonna go to the side now because gibi said it was okay alright yeah see i gotta get the back layers of your hair tyler did you just cross the frame its just like youre here filming with us okay here we go oh yeeeeeaaaah see when youre cutting someone elses hair its just so much easier that was a pretty big chunk alright let me take a look you kinda have a mullet thing going on right now but i can fix that i just gotta get to the back of your head here we go alright let me hold it on like this there we go alriight now thats what im talking about i mean i think your hair looks pretty good at this point theres no extremely jagged parts you kind of have like um cousinette kind of thing going on just because your bangs are so long in the front but besides that youre looking pretty good i would say that you should still probably get it fixed by a professional but you could last a few days in public without that so youre welcome do a little turn yeah okay one sec at the back leave something to be desired but its not that bad tyler this couldve been your haircut it wou it is

my social media handles and a big shoutout to cocobean for watching thanks for watching cocobean and ill see you guys ahnext time   hello friends and welcome to another video today im gonna be melting one of every candle from bath  body works together into a frankencandle  thats right bad makeup science is evolving into just bad science i guess so i have previously mixed together every beauty gurus eyeshadow palette and every lipstick from sephora to find the average or most marketable eyeshadow or lipstick shade with generally pleasing results and so of course my beady little eyes have been searching for something else to mix and seeing that it is the holiday season the first thing that came to my mind was bath  body works who go ham during the holidays with their seasonal candles now bath  body works has been around for a while in the early to mid  they were especially notorious for their body sprays of which i had many but sometime over the years their candle game has evolved into one of the most wellknown parts of their brand helped by the demand they create with their large sale on candle day and the seasonal limited edition candles they release people freak out about bath  body works candles ngela i look around theres barely anybody in the stfreaking store exhales loudly saf and im not immune to this i also love a good three wick burner and they have such a large inventory of candles they really do have something for every nose so i was thinking if i bought one of every candle that bath  body works sells particularly now as they have both their normal odor inventory as well as their holiday scents out could i create the ultimate layered megacandle of my wildest dreams something that works for all seasons kind of like christmas in july well theres only one way to find out all right lets do it so we are outside bath  body works right now and were gonna go in and try and buy one of every candle scent that they sell now from looking at the website we noticed that they have multiple listings for candles with the same name alright so these both say mahogany teakwood so before purchasing any i wanted to see if they were actually different scents or just the same candle with different packaging i think theyre the same so i guess we only need one of these so thats candle number 1 with that settled i pretty much just got to work grabbing candles and unlike lipsticks candles are large and heavy so my bag started filling up fast im just covered in candles can i give you this bag tyler yes  so after sweeping the store and going from display to display to make sure we had at least one of every scent available at this location 
 oooh its fine we checked out but even though we had what felt like a crap ton of candles we soon realized we didnt have nearly as many as we had counted online in fact im pretty sure we only have about  candles in here oh   candles which is actually about half of all the candles we need so were gonna have to fill in some holes now when we brought our candles home we crossreferenced them with the list of candles we found online and quickly noticed that a fair amount of the candles we had bought instore werent listed on the website at all and on top of that most of the ones not listed were the limited edition holiday candles so i ordered every remaining candle that was available online and then hit another bath  body works to see if there were any holiday ones that werent at the first store saf luckily for us they had plenty of christmas candles but unluckily for us a lot of the christmas candle names sound very similar to each other but we did end up finding  more candles that we hadnt found either at the first store or online so i would say that it was a success and adding that to the  candles from the first store and the  candles ordered from the website we ended up with  different candles there were one or two that were sold out online and probably a couple that we didnt even know about and couldnt find but i would say that we bought pretty close to every candle available from bath and body works pretty damn close okay so these are all of our candles untopped safiya decapped just to ya know see what im getting myself into i mean with all of them open i am getting like so many different scents in my nostrils its hard to think over here its a little harder to say but over here it smells like froot loops i think and just based on the fact that it smells kind of different as i move around i dont think that well be able to figure out what the final scent will be just from this so i think its time to start figuring out how exactly were going to melt all of these together so im going to categorize these candles into sorta like scent families just based on which ones i think go together they do also list the fragrance notes for each candle on the bottom of the jar as well as on the website but for my purposes im gonna be grouping them sort of subjectively and once theyre all sorted my process is to basically take a melon baller and scoop out a little bit of wax from each candle to put into our mixture and hopefully one scoop from over  candles will gather together enough wax to make one candle the frankencandle the frank  body works safiya also this hot plate is not on im gonna put in all the wax cold first and then melt it later so our first scent category is foods not christmas foods more like brunch foods and im gonna start off with this one french baguette now this is our only single wick candle because its the only one we couldnt find in a three wick other ones are available in the smaller jar but i like the big ones oh that smells wonderful it smells like a toasted croissant alright so im gonna start scooping this one has like the smallest surface area to scoop so this one might be tough saf oh my god saf oh there we go there we go tyler oh yeah saf alright so next im gonna use this like giant toothpick to poke the wax out of the melon baller cause its not stuck but you know its waxy and with that we have one candle down hundreds to go well like a hundred and a few alright so lets start getting into our groove here you know what i mean lets start scooping saf lets start ballin i raise my leg like a  like a stork saf thats how i ball so in this food category we have  candles most of which are generally sweet and the majority of their fragrance notes have to do with vanilla sugar sea salt and different fruits namely peaches lemons and all kinds of berries and though i would say a lot of them have similar notes they do have varying levels of boldness tyler what is that
saf oh  i feel like theres just like two buckets of candles like candles you can stick your face in and candles that stick their face in you oooooaaaaaaah like this banana split milkshake candle is almost offensive but its not even the baddest of the bunch okay so this one is a blueberry maple pancake candle which smells a little bit like if ihop got smacked in the face by a blueberry 
saf yep and the smell actually gets stronger when i dig into it with the melon baller saf  ooooooaaahhh thats a strong one mr grinch and then this is the last foodscented candle at least until we get to the seasonal ones and this one is called georgia peach  theres been a murder in savannah georgia i know that like no one from georgia really talks like that anymore saf but im really just referencing the office right now so with all of that wax scooped lets take a whiff of our concoction so far ooh  right now i pretty much smell only blueberries but well see what happens over the next couple of hours so next up were moving on to what i would call the spa scent category and i would generalize them by saying it seems like it would be nice if someone sprayed it on your face so a big staple for the notes in this section is flowers in addition to the somewhat ambiguous water fragrance which i think kinda fits the spa theme as well as a speckling of citrus and i think that in general these sort of like floral leafy spa scents are a little less pungent theyre more of a fragrance than an odor and i think that maybe because of their subtlety some of them really strum some nostalgia strings like villa bergamot this one smells like the gift shop at colonial williamsburg and white tea  ginger which smells like my baby doll did when i was 5 saf yes definitely  alright so checking back in with the pot hmm mmhmm it definitely smells a little more floral but im still smelling the blueberry i am i swear i am with like a touch of lemonsomething alright so after this category i have three candles that all smell like abercrombie  fitch all of them are like some variation on teakwood which must just mean abercrombie  fitch smell oh yeah thats abercrombie i know this scent well it haunts me in my dreams i just hear like pounding house music and i smell this scent they also have this one called mahogany teakwood high intensity which is for when you wanna smell like you went into abercrombie  fitch with your friends in  and never left and then the next category is six aromatherapy candles with two eucalyptus candles kinda like thrown in the bunch and after all those our concoction smells like blueberry  with a dash of like soap so im not sure if any of the therapeutic elements of these candles are gonna make it through to the final mixture i dont know if anyone can truly be relaxed when smelling that blueberry one so our next category is summer so im gonna start off this round with island margarita there are  candles in this category and actually a fair amount of them are named after drinks now we do have an entire separate section of alcoholic drinks coming up next but i would say that these are like summer  drinks and in terms of the scents coconut as well as other fruit like mango and pineapple are wellrepresented theres also a few candles with general ocean scents and assorted wood smells ocean driftwood kinda smells like hollister i guess teakwood smells like abercrombie and driftwood smells like hollister i will say though that i think that most of the candles in this section smell pretty nice and they are making our mixture smell more like coconut that may be though because there are a lot of tropical candles on top so well see when it melts who really comes out on top so next up lets move on to the new yearsalcoholic drinks category so first up in this round is champagne toast which smells i think ive lost the ability to smell it says its supposed to smell like champagne berries and tangerine i do smell some berries but its almost like berry tums besides that i would say the candles in this category are meant to smell sort of like party drinks cologne or perfume for example the most popular notes are champagne fruit manly scents like sandalwood driftwood and leather and perfumey scents like patchouli amber and peonies party dress actually smells kind of good unfortunately it seems that after about  candles my ability to smell is somewhat going away in the stars kinda smells like party dress now i think i forget what party dress smells like can i get high from this  saf alright and then this last one of the festive category is called black tie and it smells also like party dress 
saf im confused okay so with that were done with the new years celebration alcohol category and were moving on into the more seasonal candles so im gonna go for a quick walk to clear out my nose and then well move on to the fall candles so this section has  candles and i would say the general vibe is things you would smell or eat or wear around a bonfire with common notes such as cinnamonclove wood sugar and a little bit of pumpkin theyre kinda like the candles that bath  body works probably tries to sell before its like really couth to put out the christmas candles its like the early november candles saf exactly this one smells kinda like michaels like craft store tyler oh yeah saf i just wanna—  ohhh it exploded sorry i got too excited and as for how our mixture smells after the autumn scents i think i am picking up on some of the cloves that were left behind though i am still smelling a lot of like the fruitier scents from earlier so weve got cloves and fruits take that as you will so next up is our winter category which i categorized by taking candles that were definitely seasonal but were not specifically christmasthemed i would say theyre more in like the snow frosty forest category tyler a walk through the forest in december saf yes so this group has  candles and theyre generally supposed to smell like trees like cedar pine and fir as well as spices like cinnamon nutmeg and clove there are also a few citrus notes berry notes and planty notes as well as one supersweet hot cocoa candle that doesnt have like any of the other notes we mentioned oh this is a bold one but its definitely winterish  oooh oohhooh  whoah saf all is well saf sparkling woods just came for my wig saf i know i wonder what will be the wig of  my moneys on merkin woah my merkin its flown okay and with that we are done with the nondenominational winter scents i will say that some of these upcoming arent necessarily denominational but i feel like they are more specifically christmastargeted either with their packaging or with their names first up we have general christmas okay so right off the bat something im very excited about is how many different colors there are in this pile i feel like we could use a little sprucin up a little spice this is cherry frost but you know what i mean and beyond the colors this category fragrancewise is pretty strongly characterized by a lot of vanilla and once again trees notably cedar wood and balsam kinda smells like a christmas wreath they also use the descriptors frosted and snowcapped a lot here but im not sure exactly what that means also a fair amount of this packaging is holo the thing is i know that cristine sent bath  body works a cease and desist for trying to take some of her holosexual branding so im gonna say they probably got this from cristine moving on this ones called merry mistletoe it actually smells like indian food  saf it kinda smells like tamarind sauce saf it also kinda smells like mint chutney though i find that often those two things are together so maybe im smelling a milieu of them both and then to finish off our penultimate category we have frosted coconut snowball a lot of words that could mean a myriad of scents saf oh yeah ive never had one of those but ive always wanted one so now i want that and indian food alright so that was christmas general it smells essentially like a psychedelic lemon bar i think some of the tree scents are starting to read lemon if that makes sense and im definitely smelling some sugar so thats where like the lemon bar comes in so now onto the final category christmas foodsdrinks christmas edibles so this is our biggest category with  candles and the fragrance notes are basically just ingredients for like christmas desserts like vanilla sugar cinnamon caramel orange ginger and my personal favorite peppermint like here weve got some mint chocolate saf right i wonder how it tastes tyler it smells like mint ice cream— saf it tastes pretty good saf yeah you want some saf dont eat candles at home kids do as i say not as i do and besides having some tasty ones this category also has some iconic bath  body works candles ah so up next we have winter candy apple which im pretty sure was one of the candles that the bath  body works freak out lady freaked out about  i dont know ive been busy taking care of bitches all fing day saf ooh saf im not sure it was  it kinda smells like juicy juice or like fruit rollup but listen i get it its the principle of the thing you know they said they were in stock and then they werent i also could not believe that that happened in appleton wisconsin  appleton wisconsin i want everybody to know this happened in appleton saf in general i would say these christmas food scents are pretty hit or miss theyre not all bad but they are all pretty strong so if its not a scent you like youre pretty much out of luck kind of like with our final candle hot buttered rum ooooh it kinda smells like root beer candy tastes saf candies though
tyler yes saf thats like a really bizarre and like maybe random reference tyler no way saf really tyler i think so saf is that mainstream let us know okay so we are finally done scooping wax out of candles now let me just give my pot a little interstitial whiff just to see how it smells before its melted hmmm  maybe just like peppermint berry sugar but i guess well find out what it actually smells like after we melt it down i think though my hands are a little tired and our noses are a little tired so im gonna call it a night and then in the morning well check back in and melt it alright so its the next day and because of daylight savings its almost the next night but regardless were gonna melt whoooh oh it smells caramelly this morning
 afternoon evening what time is it now im gonna turn on the hot plate to start melting the wax from below so well see i guess from above if anything starts happening okay so it looks like after letting the mixture melt for about  minutes its definitely deflated there was a decent amount of height to our wax mountain and now its more like a lump maybe alright so what im gonna do next is bring in this hairdryer just so we can heat up the top layers of wax because clearly the bottom layers are melting and the top layers just kinda chillin so with out wax shavings melting together we are almost at our final franken mixture now as we mentioned we had  candles that were scooped for this experiment and all of those candles had a total of  fragrance notes listed saf and the most popular notes overall were any variation on wood vanilla sugar cinnamon mint orange coconut apple clove and musk i will say though that some scents are just stronger than others so even if they are listed less frequently they might still poke through im looking at you demon blueberry it kinda looks like a grape jolly rancher and malt liqueur alright so after a little more hairdrying its melted into this like dark potiony looking concoction saf  hello clarice and now its time to mold it into a candle so ive got a large frankencandle jar right here and i have these kind of like wick adhesive thingies so im just gonna stick three wicks in there and once weve done that im gonna tape the tails to the side of the jar so the wicks dont fall in while were making the candle alright there we go now i think all thats left is to pour the wax in should i go like down the middle saf alright let me try saf oooooooh is that enough too much oh my god its a tall candle saf yeah saf wow oh thats awesome oh my god its already hardening ooh yeeeeeah yes tyler its hardening saf yes its already hardening look at the outside so i think our mixture is looking pretty cool right now that ombre is everything i might even say its lit saf but it seems like its gonna take a while to fully solidify so lets just leave it here leave this camera rolling so we can maybe get a little timelapse situation and then we will cut our wicks and smell our candle okay so here it is there she blows as some would say i think that in the end shes really dried down to be kind of like a dusty lavender color which is interesting though i guess it makes sense thinking back to how many of those candles were blue and red so im just gonna head upstairs to actually smell the candle just because there are a lot of uh competing fragrances down here also i brought some coffee upstairs just because some people say that smelling coffee is like a palate cleanser for your nose this coffees like over a year old for sure and after that its time for the whiff of truth its not bad but its hard to pinpoint like a name for what im smelling i think berry honestly it is a little bit of a caramelly scent i think its like a sugared berry tyler okay saf and thats my best guess tyler you know what maybe its stuck in my nostrils but im smelling some of that blueberry somewhere deep in there saf so now that weve both smelled it cold i think weve gotta light this sucker up okay it smells really good when lit tyler oh yeah saf i think its still a berry smell though tyler okay saf im getting like a cozy indoor berry cookie tyler maybe a pancake saf it is possible that the blueberry maple pancake ended up on top but even if thats true the frankenbody works scent definitely has some layers to it that are hard to pin down and i really wanna be able to convey those to you guys effectively so i embarked on a smell quest to get more opinions on our candle to share with all of you im gonna go up to strangers and ask them to smell my candle hahaha this isnt creepy at all tyler it does sound sexual saf it sounds like a euphemism for something so right off the bat we had people corroborating our guesses as to what the frankencandle smelled like  its sweet maybe something baked like a cupcake maybe saf any undertones pretend youre a candle sommelier  maybe some fruity like raisin undertones saf raisin with opinions like baked goods and fruit saf as well as some holiday undertones saf cinnamon alright fair anything else but there was also a contingent of people who were picking up on undertones of the candle that i could not smell saf floral a bath  body works totally saf okay with a few votes for flowers  smells like saf lavender thats our second lavender i am totally missing the lavender here so after getting some conflicting opinions out in public we decided to go see daniel stone at stone candle bar in santa monica where they both produce and sell candles as well as hold custom candlemaking classes daniel we did something weird  daniel thats what ive heard and we were hoping he could give us an expert opinion  would you like me just to saf yeah just
 put my two cents into this saf put your nose right in it  alright so immediately it smells like a holiday scent as holiday scents tend to be overpowering and kind of gormandize and rich now if you dont mind i can get a little bit more out of this if i rub the wax and let the notes kind of come out
saf sure yeah saf swatch it  still really overpowering with that apple cinnamon type cookie vanilla scent now in an attempt to figure out exactly what the frankenbody works smelled like on our own we had actually sniffed all our candles and picked out  that were kind of close none of them were perfect but if you hold chestnut  clove hot cocoa and the dreaded blueberry pancakes up to your face at the same time i think you can kind of smell all of the layers of the frankencandle yep thats pretty good so weve been trying to figure out like with our own devices what it smells like  yeah saf and we came up with blueberry pancake  yeah blueberry pancake totally saf hot cocoa and chestnut clove  chestnut chestnut is a great one in there saf alright there we go so it sounds like our little three candle combo was the way to go  im sure you put other things in here saf we did   im sure there was some ocean fragrances and some sandalwoods and a clean linen and all those wonderful things are just overpowered by the food fragrances and so thats what you end up with alright so expert opinion it smells kind of like blueberries plus sort of a cinnamony holiday undertone  walnut chestnut cocoa yeah that should do it saf alright so i think that is our best attempt at conveying the essence of the frankenbody works now what i will say is that i think the candle looks good and smells enjoyable but like daniel said you cant really smell any of the nonsweet scents so im not sure it really is the best of all seasons its more just like christmas and i think that has to do with just how strong the food scents are because even though notes like mint musk eucalyptus and sandalwood were very popular i dont really smell them at all regardless i am pretty pleased with our final candle and im definitely gonna be burning it for a long long time and while im not sure i would recommend frankencandleing as i dont know if im gonna be doing it again and it did give tyler a prolonged headache i am now pleased with the amount of candles i have to use in the coming months id say we have pretty much a years supply of candles right here saf i mean not if we burn it literally  saf oh  thank you guys so much for watching our final video of  let us know in the comments below what you think we should name our frankencandle if you liked that video make sure to shamash that like button and if you wanna see more videos like this make sure to shamash that subscribe button here are my social media handles and a big shoutout to emma for watching thanks for watching emma and i will see you guys anext year  hello friends and welcome to another video today im going to be taking over the channel and i guess hopefully getting engaged i guess well all find out in a few minutes as of now i still dont know so as you guys may or may not know safiya and i have been dating for like over 4 years and since then weve done a lot of stuff weve seen each other through career changes weve traveled the world together weve adopted and taken care of a dumpster cat together hey buddy  and for the last couple of years weve worked pretty much nonstop on this channel together so we spend a lot of time together when i say 4 years i mean like literally 4 years and because were always together its gonna be like really hard to surprise her so im going to have to film this video in chunks probably while shes at yoga thats like the one activity that she does that i dont like to do its just so hot now i think since pretty early on it always felt like we were gonna be together forever sort of like we were already married saf oh my god leave me alone tyler im bitter and although weve been talking about getting actually married for a while now i guess the only reason why were not yet is because when we started dating when we were kinda young but now were less young so it seems like a good time and i dont know i just really want to marry her so im gonna ask full disclosure i am a little nervous but im not planning on using something like a jumbotron so i think ill be okay  but as for how i am gonna propose well get to that in a second for step one of this plan i needed a ring so as you guys may also know safiya sort of thinks that shes a bat i know this is the woman im marrying or at least trying to marry but with that in mind i thought itd be cool to get a black engagement ring to kinda go with her whole motif presumably shell be wearing it a lot shell be wearing black a lot itll be good after doing some research these like really black diamonds are actually treated to get this black but there are these natural black diamonds that are more like a smoky grey that i think are pretty awesome so i scoured a few jewelry stores in la as well as many online stores looking for natural black diamonds and after finding several pretty good options some with extra diamonds around them some with little skirts i finally found one that i really liked and i ordered it here it is safiya does not know we have this right now ive been hiding this in a random mailbox the last couple of days and the delivery guy came when we were working so i had to play this off as though it was a box from urban outfitters im not sure safiya bought it but we order a lot of stuff from urban outfitters tyler oh yeah  oh thats awesome okay so here it is i think it definitely captures that bat vibe that i wanted though it leans kind of eye of saurony which was unintentional but kind of welcomed yeah thats awesome this is exactly what i wanted lets see if it fits me i have chubbier fingers okay so its like at my knuckle i could wear it so i think it looks great and i think shes gonna love it so now lets move on to how im gonna do it down and  away well thats a nice click one more time  good noise okay so as i said its gonna be kind of hard to do this as a surprise because of aforementioned being together a lot but i think i have an idea now oftentimes maybe once a monthish saf and i will go to disneyland usually at night after editing all day or uploading a video so i was thinking i could just sort of offer up the idea of going to disneyland tonight and while were there i could propose and disneyland is actually kind of a great place because in addition to us going there a lot its also sort of the location of our first date more like the unofficialbeforeweweredating date its actually kind of a point of contention because safiya complains that i didnt make a move on said notrealdate  there were many opportunities and he did not take them and then when he dropped me off at home afterwards i was waiting for him to lean in for the kiss and he didnt and i was like mildly offended  i was sort of looking at it like a transitional date like moving from friendship to courtship but since then its kind of become our goto date spot and we often film wearing ugly clothing items there so within disneyland our key destination is the snow white wishing well which we go to throw coins into make a wish etc etc every time we visit we came here the first time that we were on our first date but also saf you always come here right  so im thinking thats the money spot now the next question is im thinking it would be fun to film it and share it with you guys so we have to get a camera down there and someone else there to film it happening from afar unfortunately were not currently filming something that would justify me like bringing a camera there and definitely not another person so if i did either of those things itd be a pretty big tell so im gonna have our editors emily who youve seen drop a rock before and claire whos also in that video for a brief moment take one of our cameras down to disneyland before us and be waiting strategically by the well so that they can jump out at the right moment alright so ill see you guys in a few hours alright so thats the plan i guess saf is probably gonna be home soon i dont have a watch so im gonna go rehide this ring  i think were gonna be working for a few more hours and then well see if safiya wants to go to disneyland she usually does so i guess this is probably happening tonight what do you think pretty good right would you say yes crust ah cmon youd say yes bring it around town he thinks its a snack okay so this is happening we are going to disney pretty sure claire and emily are down there waiting for us im gonna text them in a second but this is not a drill this is happening so im really excited emily alright so were here at disney we are going to go to the secret hiding spot  secret filming location  secret filming location

 i did  there
 yes  on the finger  did you like the quick hand up  that was pretty good yeah i put that there  congratulations  thank you
 okay so were you surprised  i cant say i didnt suspect anything  right fair  in all of the days and weeks leading up to it  im not that discrete    but i will say that i was definitely overwhelmed with emotion  you cried  i cried a lot
 a fair amount yes  i didnt expect to be such a crier  yeah it wasnt too much crying i think it was the right amount of crying  we did cut some crying  we did wwe had to  there were some squawks but i me like in the moment they were cute  is this normal  i have no idea its a good cry though right its a good cry so did you like my speech i was rehearsing that in my head i was thinking thats why i wasnt talking on the way over here i was nervous my original plan was i was gonna end the speech with will you marry this dingus i dont know why on the tram i was like oh i got the best final line but then you were crying and i just forgot to say it i wanted to be like are we gonna get married  i mean i think that i would have said yes even if you said will you marry this dingus  oh that might have reversed it  oh no no no  you wouldve been like let me think for a second here  i might have had to do a loop around the well and come back  okay lets think about it alright so heres the big question well i mean its another question  this is the big question  this is a video full of big questions did you like the ring do you like the ring  i love it yeah  i think its awesome  you wanna give me a little high five for the ring choice there you go for anyone in the comments she likes the ring  it does kind of look like the eye of sauron which im like very pleased about but it also looks like the dark grey version of elle woods engagement ring seen in legally blonde 2 im just worried that im gonna lose it  im really worried that youre gonna lose it  yeah just because i feel like i dont usually wear a lot of jewelry and i just feel like i could easily put it down and then  minutes later be like baaaaaah so im just gonna have to be really careful i also like that after the proposal you tried to film me and the ring in various locations for no reason  im trying to get a shot of you and the the background its cool i dont know maybe show the ring yeeeeeah sparkly it was an action shot im already evolving into the video cam dad i was just like let me film it its on your finger let me film it  thats tylers final form  yeah thats coming because all of that footage  we looked at it  is completely unusable  i think i sort of sealed my own fate there when i just initially gave you the camera  oh i thought you were gonna say you sealed your face when you said yes  oh fair enough  so thats kind of our announcement  yes we havent set a date yet or anything weve sort of talked about it i think were shooting for late next year and were probably gonna do a couple of videos about it  right  were not gonna turn into a wedding channel necessarily
 no  and by necessarily i mean were not going to but we are going to make some videos as the content appears also i just wanted to slide this in here we do film a lot of our videos out of order so if you see me not wearing my ring its probably just because we filmed that before this  yes  i also do though have an irrational fear of dropping this into a steaming vat of lipsticks so i might also not choose to wear my ring in strategic videos going forward so if you dont see me wearing it its not a big deal is it okay if i dont wear it  yeah i dont want you to lose it into a vat of lipstick  okay so i think thats it  yes  tylers abdicated all responsibility  im just taking this outro off  hes like i did my thing and now im just gonna chill thank you guys so much for watching if you liked that video should we ask them to shmash that like button i feel like that might be a little shameless  hey itd be nice why not like away i dont know  and if you want to see more videos not necessarily like this make sure to shmash that subscribe button  you can only really do it one time  ideally
 yes alright well were engaged now that was the tyler takeover and i guess well see you guys anext time  yes alright sorry  im excited to film  okay fine im not going to i am like dad home videoing it right now  im like smile  you said yes hello friends and welcome to another video this week were going to be taking on yet another questionable fashion item thighhigh uggs yes thats right your middle school selfs favorite winter shoes have gone sexual well maybe not sexual but theyve definitely grown up now i was first made aware of these uggs back in january of this year when designer brand yproject sent them down the runway during paris fashion week yes that is the same yproject of four foot long sleeve denim jacket fame and with one glance at these boots as always the internet had feelings bizarre thighhigh ugg boots divide the internet this yproject ugg collab will trigger you yes folks theyre real  and theyre horrifying but regardless of whatever feelings people have about this mid  fever dream here are the facts they are very tall they seem very warm although i guess thats not a fact and they are much more expensive than their shrunken ancestors which arent all that cheap to begin with but because im predictable i bought them and now they are here tyler i actually might need your help i dont think i can just like pick it up off camera oh alright so this large package is my uggs im pretty impressed by the size of the box and i was also even more impressed by the size of like the shipping box that these came in we had recently ordered a sofa and we thought it could possibly be a sofa its a little sticky oh there we go alright so im going to open up the tissue paper oh so here is a thighhigh ugg that is probably literally the size of a third grader oh my god it can stand up on its oh no it cant i mean besides like the intimidating height it does look mostly like a normal ugg its definitely more like wrinkly up here but down here its got the sort of signature flat ugg shape they did have a heeled thighhigh ugg version but i felt like looking at that one it was missing some of the classic essence of ugg alright and there is boot number two you cant see me anymore because the ugg is blocking my entire being this is where i live now in a cave made of uggs this is like eeyores house im like a little bit speechless just from the sheer height of these things but based on the title of this video i think im gonna have to wear them so lets try them on shall we alright so standing next to them they are definitely thighhigh i would even call them like crotch height you know pube height if you will alright do you wanna take a look inside except it just descends into nothingness its a portal to hades or to australia this is like a colonoscopy t that is the view from australia
 alright so without further ado lets put my feet in here oh oh my god okay im in my foots in i think that the top could go a little higher but i think it has reached a point where my thigh is too thick for like the leg opening  
yeah alright theyre on i guess i mean theyre incredibly cozy i feel like from this level of my leg down im just in a giant blanket which is awesome and actually inside right now im not too hot but im worried about my mobility as it is a little bit hard to walk around because the uggs hit each other but i guess thats something were going to have to figure out this week along with temperature control and general styling quack quack quack quack either that or i look like dustin like trying to capture dartagnan the demodog you know im like sht sht sht sht sht you ate my cat so for day one of our uggventure i wanted to style the uggs like yproject had styled them for their runway show so i have this sort of like oversized white longsleeved turtleneck tshirt were those all the words i needed to say and i added a couple of safety pins to simulate the sort of like wrinkle or blouse effect that yproject has on their garment i also went for some floofy hoop earrings as well as a nudey makeup look so since i was going for a recreation of how yproject themselves styled the uggs im not sure if its up to me to say whether or not this outfit works im trying to be avantgarde high fashion is this fashion but if i were to guess what yproject is going for with this look i would say its a wrinkled and comfy vibe the specific designer who sort of like came up with the idea for this collab really seemed to harp on like the softness of the ugg so i feel like in general its supposed to be like im soft there is some harmony with like the scrunches of the uggs and like the single scrunch of the shirt and i do think that that is like reflective of yprojects like general aesthetic they seem to love like wrinkly scrunched draped oversized things yes potato vibes but fashion potato so as for actually wearing these boots out into the world for the first time i had a few thoughts first off i found them quite toasty okay in the shade its not so bad but in the sun im like a sweat ball oh im warm im warm everyone im warm i also found them kind of tough to move in because as you walk the material of each boot rubs against each other im like wading through peanut butter but its just like ugg which sort of does raise the question for me how did people walk down a runway gracefully in these because i tried to come up with like a runway walk in these shoes and it wasnt very good t hey tyra always says you want to have a signature walk thats a signature walk this is it i call it the compass i will say though that when wearing these boots without pants they dont get stuck on your thighs as much theyre definitely more slouchy without leg wear to give them some traction and with the extra room i was actually able to turn the tops inside out which is how the girl i was copying wore hers but then you can see my tag i bet you i could trim the tag but im nervous to bring scissors near these t yeah thats probably not a good idea maybe ill try and trim them off once weve uploaded the video so for day two i wanted to look to a celebrity who has actually worn the thigh high uggs for my outfit inspiration so i went for a loose recreation of rihannas thigh high ugg outfit and her general aesthetic was ugg a lot of gold jewelry and a sort of like brown toned scarf tied around her body though she did have like the pointed toe and heeled thigh high uggs i felt like the color scheme and general proportions were the same so i feel like the look was somewhat transferable so to capture her look i went for a copper toned velvet dress from fashion nova everyone i am a nova babe which obviously isnt quite as bold as just wearing some strategic fabric im not sure im ready for the scarf t youtube definitely isnt s thats true ad distributors are not ready for the scarf t no s but it did have a little drapery in a similar location to some of her scarfs ties creating sort of a comparable tan and bunchy effect i will say it is sort of like a sexy sharpei look  t from high school musical no like the wrinkle dogs t ooh got it
 overall i think i get what shes going for by trying to match her top to the boots i kinda feel like a tin man or i guess more like a bronze man but even though i had attempted to go for a more wearable version of her outfit i still had some difficulties as my fashion nova dress fashion novad and kept riding up as i walked 
literally im flashing everyone why is this happening t its just a very personal video this is your truth so maybe i shouldve just worn the scarf i am not sure if this was a successful styling but i think i gave a few people in their cars a nice view so for our third ugg day i wanted to finally take my fate into my own hands and try to style these uggs for myself so i have sort of like a loose black turtle neck sweater dress as well as some exciting earrings take the shots from far away because my side burns are out and about my thought process when choosing this outfit was that i have to find something short enough to like show off the uggs in their entirety but i also want something autumnal to like go with like the coziness of the uggs i havent worn a sweater in a while t were comin up with sweater weather t swedda wedda s in general i thought this outfit moderately worked my turtle neck sweater dress was kinda giving me cafe vibes like perhaps i should have included a beret or a baguette  but even without the imaginary beret i feel like the fall elements throughout complimented each other but as i was warming up to these boots figuratively and literally i figured i was in need of a sanity check just to see what everyone else thought so we posted a photo of this outfit to instagram where you guys are brutally honest so after a few days our pic racked up about  comments some of which were positive  oh my god you look like link from legend of zelda i stan more of which were negative  hmm i hate these and a few which i didnt understand  you look like tana mongeau if she was a canadian fourth grader in general i would say you guys came up with some pretty good comparative imagery  ariana grande but make it winter bagged lunch but make it fashion looks like kebab to me but i think the overall consensus was after looking at them for a second you did not like them now im not sure id be quite so hard on them looks wise but i have been spending a lot of time with them so i may be developing a soft spot speaking of softness though one thing i started to notice by day three was how flaccid they were becoming with repeated wears as they started to sag a lot as i walked around and required mere constant maintenance and i was also starting to see more creases in the toe from like the motion of my foot as i walked and though i feel like its pretty common knowledge that uggs get worn in over time i guess just thinking about the price of these one would hope that they would be a little hardier just smoothing dont worry but at the end of the day theyre not theres just more ugg so for day four i wanted to throw it back a little bit to the dawn of the ugg era with a mid  inspired outfit its like this is me ten years later these are the uggs ten years later remember uggs this is what they look like now feel old yet so for this outfit i went for a denim mini skirt to really hone in on that iconic weather confused look which is essentially normal la clothes but also uggs as well as a white layering tank top and a pink juicy couture velour hoodie the other really key part of the outfit is that my hair gets stuck in my lip gloss thats a must and then you also have to eat a little bit of lip gloss t yeah though my memory of uggs begins in the  which is from what i can tell really when they became fashionable among the youths uggs actually have a somewhat lengthy history my knees are hot i think now i owe  cents to paris hilton before the pink juicy mini skirted era of the ugg hay day before their mainstream breakthrough as one of oprahs favorite things in  and before they were featured on the feet of the us winter olympic team in  uggs were a surfing shoe in the  ugg boots were popular with australian surfers who wore them for warmth after hitting some chilly waves brah and yes they were called uggs long before the brand ugg came around one australian manufacturer claims that he named his boots uggs in  after his wife commented that the first pair he made were ugly while some argue that the name comes from the fug boots worn by the royal air force during wwi which coincidentally was short for flying ugly now what really surprises me about uggs is their past as a surfing boot given their propensity for staining and wear and tear though i guess their beachy origins make wearing them with a mini skirt more reasonable what doesnt surprise me is that people have always had hang ups over the way uggs look as even at their peak in the  they were mocked pretty mercilessly i refuse to have elephant feet elephant feet so i guess the question is why would yproject who are extensively fashionable want to make thigh high versions of these bad boys well i guess one possible reason is the coziness the saving grace of the ugg has always been the comfort so i guess why not just have more of it as their designer implied but im not sure thats the whole story i think the more likely scenario given all these headlines is that they are trying to be subversive now thigh high boots have been considered sexy and fashion forward womens wear since the  in cahoots with the rise of the mini skirt so mashing up a boot that is definitely sexy with a boot that is arguably ugly might just be juxtaposey enough to be provocative something to note is that yproject isnt the only trendy brand to collab with ugg even in the last year so perhaps theyre all looking for a bit of their own shock and ugg but even if these collabs are a bit tongue and cheeky at the end of the day i think the joke is on the ugg haters as ugg seems to be content trading in some roasting for continued relevance which is more than you can say for a lot of other  trends now in regards to my historical outfit i didnt really mind it all that much i think because it was an homage to a nostalgic and familiar look its less avantgarde because youre like yeah i remember that t i mean i dont remember these but i remember something like these s and even though i never owned my own uggs as a youngin this look took me back to a different time t i feel like you put those uggs on with this outfit and youre a teenager s thats how i feel im just slightly less hormonal and i got a bit of a bigger butt but besides that very teenaged so for the last three days of our ugg week tyler and i happened to be traveling to philadelphia to visit tylers family and i am taking my uggs with me so they can experience some colder weather now one unexpected obstacle was the question of how to get them to philadelphia now i was all ready to like stick my little things back in my uggs and pack them up but they are larger than our suitcase and though i could have like folded them in half i was concerned based on the fact they had already started to crease in other places that they would just get like a big crease down the middle t you know what this means right s i think im gonna have to wear them on the plane this was not my finest decision now we didnt leave our house late for our flight but there was a lot of traffic at the airport itself so we ended up having to park and run and yes i was sprinting in my thigh high uggs t im filmin ya and im runnin so its hard so my plan to keep them safe by wearing them was completely out the window before we even got on the plane i dont know yet well see now after running through the airport we did eventually make our flight which was good but it also meant that my legs were very sweaty and also trapped inside an ugg in an airplane s oh yeah did we mention were on a red eye now in an attempt to sleep i took my uggs off but even so they took up a lot of valuable leg space so it was a very uncomfortable flight ive been clutching them between my thighs in my sleep for hours and needless to say i probably should have just packed them so for day five our first day in philly i wanted to go for sort of like a winter casual outfit sort of like an outfit you might actually wear with uggs but the uggs are just really big so my usual winter casual would of course be all black a block of black and a block of tan t variety is the spice of life s exactly so during this day we took the uggs to see some classic philadelphia sights we went to the art museum which is also home to the rocky steps like the steps that he runs up in while hes training t youre gonna sweat a lot but yeah you can like jog up and then like you know s and then at the top im like t you like celebrate yeah s okay alright which was definitely a challenge to recreate with the uggs on t youe carrying a lot of dead weight here s thats how you train right t yeah s you need some drag t these are almost like those ankle weights s yeah all right now what do i do turn around t yeah you just gotta put your arms up s i tried this a few times t make em a little more vertical t yeah as it seemed like a popular activity after that i realized that the museums marquee exhibit was called fabulous fashion t if thats not fashion nothing is s so it was almost as if they had anticipated my arrival t oh yeah s fabulous uggs t after watching this video they should replace that sign with your uggs s yeah absolutely i dont know who that is get her out of there  get out so to continue our tour of philadelphia we headed over to independence hall to harass the birth place of our nation with thigh high uggs i just wonder if the founding fathers knew it would come to this  i also think my favorite founding father ben franklin wouldve liked them you know theyre innovative new inventiony t and they cost lots of benjamins s okay finally to conclude our philadelphia day we visited wawa now while in wawa i found an unintended use for the saggage of my uggs snack hiding now i dont advocate shoplifting but you can definitely sneak some stuff in there i think probably the most legal use for this would be to like sneak a bunch of snacks into a movie theatre also yes i did buy these so dont worry philadelphia pd so for our penultimate ugg outfit i let the ugg inside me run wild and i ended up in a head to toe ugg themed ensemble i see your thigh high uggs and i raise you person high uggs hey yproject whats good one thing thats interesting to note is that i was able to actually like get all of these other items in store right now which im not sure is indicative of the popularity of uggs but rather the popularity of fuzz also we are at valley forge park outside of philadelphia and im just letting everyone know where we are in case you hear some revolutionary drums in the background the drums werent intentional but they were present anyway back to the outfit i do think that like part of the point of these uggs is that theyre trying to simulate like the ugg growing and like taking over your leg so i thought why not go one step further and let the fuzzy fungus consume my body in its entirety t the fuzz rises s the fuzz rises in addition to matching the uggs as well as the fall foliage i also coincidentally matched tylers sisters dog taz so because of that we borrowed him for the day as an additional extension of the outfit unfortunately for him because i mean i guess hes getting a walk but you know now he has to hang out with me t he has a socio with the uggs s yeah t sorry taz t hes looking away s now i guess well never know if he liked the outfit or not hes just going uggs be damned hes goin but he didnt try and chew on me so maybe i wasnt super convincing as a human boot t i think he is running away from the uggs s so to wrap up our week wearing thigh high uggs i decided to go for another assortment of our so called ugly items t what terror hath you unleashed onto pennsylvania so to pair with my uggs i brought out the yproject four foot long sleeve denim jacket as well as my asos band ruffle tee and my never before seen hairy leggings t dear thigh high uggs you started at dua lipa and rihanna and now you are here look we call that the reverse drake s i think that the yproject jacket was a definite must seeing as it is also from yproject and it also features some scrunching elements t you know the wrinkles make the outfit more consistent now the hairy leggings arent necessarily my favorite so called ugly pair of pants its actually probably the stretching thats most upsetting cause its giving it sort a like greenish hue as some of you guys may know we do have a few pairs of ugly pants including our clear knee mom jeans completely clear jeans 8 foot long jeans and also like a couple of other assorted pants but its hard to find things that will fit inside the uggs and i thought if i put anything plastic in there it would either fog up or not fit so hairy leggings it was now though i wouldnt say  this was our best ugly outfit it was sort of a fun experience wearing some unusual clothing items outside of la ive gotten a few stares i am not sure which item is garnering the stares but i dont think people are loving it but i think it was kind of nice for the ugly items to sight see a little bit travel become more worldly and scandalize some new eyes alright i feel like we should probably head home before im banned from pennsylvania forever t hey what are we going to do for christmas i dont know just stay home and eat some dinner with our hairy leggings okay so that was my week of wearing thigh high uggs as for the style of these guys i would honestly say i dont think that theyre that bad especially in some more wintery weather where theyre imposing coziness seems more justified however what i did think was kind of disappointing was how quickly they started to wear down creasing in the foot scuffing in the toe wearing down of the material where my thighs rubbed together the whole shebang as a result i spent a lot of my time wearing these shoes avoiding stepping in anything suspicious t i feel like leaves make me stressed me too and also avoiding knocking into anything at all now i know that ugg sells cleaning kits specifically to clean your uggs but when you compare the size of these things to normal uggs i would guess it would probably take 5 times the cleanser and probably 5 times the time to clean and dry them and thats not even addressing all the little nooks and crannies you would have to get into so while i personally think that  is an extremely high price point for any boot pretty much ever i think that if i were to spend that amount of money seriously on a pair of shoes i would want them to be the ride or die last forever bury me in these kind of boots i know that might not be how fashion works but its what i want thank you guys so much for watching if you liked that video make sure to shmash that like button and if you want to see more videos like this make sure to shmash that subscribe button here are my social media handles and a big shout out to kimberly for watching thanks for watching kimberly and i will see you guys next time hello friends and welcome to another video today im gonna be following a youtube tutorials instructions on how to cut my own hair and then im going to be cutting my own hair so earlier this year there was a trend of attempting to follow other peoples youtube tutorials to see if they were actually doable for example i myself recreated one of simply nailogicals nail art videos with solidly mediocre results but apparently very upsetting nail shapes so today ill be venturing into a different but arguably more high stakes genre of tutorial—hairdoing as for my current hairdo i havent cut it or done anything official to it since brad mondo snipped it for our perfect makeover video and i think its time for it to be short once more up until this point ive had trouble finding the right time to get it done mainly because i dont want to cut it in the middle of producing a video and have my hair just suddenly change but because were sort of always filming something in the background i decided to just make a video about it so it actually finally happens and maybe ill learn something in the process maybe send help now i dont think im the first person to do this— in fact i know im not the first person to do this and though my personal inspiration for this video was jenna marbles rachet salon im gonna link a few haircutting videos in the description below for your viewing pleasure so i guess with that lets begin my only hope is that i dont end up in a hairdresser reacts video uhuh that is a shook disaster okay so we have transformed our filming room into sort of like a hair studio and now im here ready to cut my hair with some hopefully protective layers on the ground and table and a giant vanity in front of me that i can barely see because my camera is right in front of it oh yeah you cant see anything so after looking through quite a bit of the youtube cutting your own hair video catalogue it seems like most of the tutorials that teach you a doable seeming method to cut your own hair are done by like recreational hair cutters and not really by professionals which make them seem more achievable but also way less sanctioned but i guess that just adds to the fun and for my hair type there seems to be like two general categories of self haircut tutorials the first of which is for like a long layered haircut and the other which is for a shorter more blunt bob cut long bobs short bobs its up to you bob as i mentioned before im looking to take out a little lenght so im leaning towards the long bob path which actually isnt a super different length than from when brad cut my hair though his style was more layered and he also lightened my hair a bit which i think woked well and looked good for like spring and summer but know that its november and its becoming winter im looking for something more severe blunt and dark
sort of like how it is at 6 pm now that daylight savings time has kicked in is it daylight savings time or standard time wellwhat did ben frankling do it oh my god i feel like thats my first negative feeling towards ben franklin so i will be dying the leftovers of my hair back to my natural color or perhaps even a bit darker and well also be following a youtube tutorial for that this could be like a fun video transition 
ready funny wheuh noise so the tutorial ive chosen is the one by sharee annonuevo and its called how to cut your hair short and straight which is what i want and her technique is to basically put your hair into two pigtails with rubber bands and then use the rubber to measure where you should cut and then chop now that seems to be the general advice from everyone to use rubber bands and then cut along the rubber bands it seems like some video employ like a unicorn horn method while others opt to tie your hair underneath your chin like a little goatee do i look like a goat like the taylor swift goat goat yell by human in background goat yells by sofia and though i would have enjoyed either of those methods i actually dont think that my hair is uniformly long enough to pull it off down here or up there so were going with pigtails so i think thats all we need to explain so lets turn on the tutorial and whip out the scissors hey guys whats up and welcome back to my channel so in todays video im going to cut my hair same so the tutorial starts with just combing out your hair so lets do that oh thare actually are a fair amount of knots in my hair and then step two is to make sure my part is where i want it to be i feel like my part is always a little bit uneven is that a line but is it straight whatever and then the third step is to divide my hair into two even sections regardless of my part and put one side to the side now heres a closeup of my dry ends and now you can clearly see that it is in need of a cut do my ends look like that kind of honestly alright and then the next step is to make like a very smooth and flat pigtail on this side with the rubber band alright how is that oh well this is not the chopping rubberband this is the intermediary rubber band and then do the same the side i just put away oh how is that i havent rocked the pigtails in a minute maybe like  like in kindergarden years alright so i will watch to confirm but im pretty sure the next step is the cutting template rubber band now with another rubber band tie that beneath the ponytail you just did this rubber band will act as a guide as to show how short you will cut your hair yes this is the important one the other one was just to throw away so its in and now im gonna pull it downwards i feel like my ideal length for this lob is like shoulder length or maybe a little bit above shoulder length but i feel like for the initial chop i should give a little bit of leeway and  like go a little longer just because like when im gonna be evening it out and fixing it i can only go shorter alright so the next i put in another measuring rubber band on the other side and i have to get the two rubber bands even so the cut is even i feel like this is pretty close to even im just gonna go check in the bathroom really quick just to make sure i think that this rubber band over here is slightly lower than this rubber band but i think the lower rubber bands are at the same height or at least sort of like approximately close near to each other  hopefully alright so im pretty sure that the next step is just to cut but lets just double check to make sure exhale im scared im scared its not that much but im still scared she is scared should i be scared i mean i guess it makes sense to be nervous but i felt like we were just going along so well so confidently she was telling me what to do and now im not so sure though i guess she did publish the video so it must not have turned out too bad in her opinion alright so she just cuts right above the rubber band she just goes for it she just just starts sawing basically im gonna do this this side first because i can see it in this mirror here oh my go alright i just wanna make sure my scissors arent like at an angle i mean i guess we would just end up with like an angled bob but thats not what this turorial is about ready oh oh my god its happening you cant say that oh my god it was totally at an angle
oh god its at an angle now its getting worse look laughter i dont know oh my god the weird thing is it looks crazy right here right it looks crazy but right here it looks okay maybe if they like trim the video like just to this part
im determined to come back and listen we all start from somewhere like drake i started from the bottom and now we hair what does that mean okay so now i think we just do hopefully the same thing on the other side im trying to now mess up the same amount on both sides ready are you serious oh my god ty im doing a really bad job oh my god oh this is a hack job this is character assasination you know what the look pretty similar i think that if i were to ever do this again i would need a couple more pigtails because my pigtails are way too thick for me to hack through yes its a similar sensation my hair smells good here do you want some i call this serial killer asmr okay so were here now so let me just see whats next up in our tutorial i think its probably take out your pigtails and look at what you have wrought but i think we should just double check i guess now its time to reveal how the actual cut looks yeah  sofia well do that im liking what im seeing but of course we need to go in and clean the cut up a bit alright there we go i guess what im gonna see and then well clean it up oooooooh oh its incredibly uneven
alright ready for the other one oh wow thats really uneven okay first eye check the lenght itself i really like i cant see the back so i cant see the jaggedness but like i like this triggered thats so rude i was gonna say im going for a dua lipa haircut and you say lord farquaad well regardless its still pretty choppy so i think weve to fix it so its even all the way around which is in fact sharees next step start by sectioning your hair off and work with the bottom layers alright so now that i have sort of like half my hair down im going to split my hair once again into like halves and then try and see if i can cut them even comb the hair straight pinch your hair with your fingers slide it down till you reach the end and then cut off those jagged ends straight alright so im giving that a go having a hard time with my depth perception as you can tell interestingly enough thats not doing a lot for me like as i let go its still realy long in the back there alright im going to do a first evening pass before i do sharees method just because i dont think that she anticipated my level of mess up see i feel like now theres less of that like crazy long stuff now its more  just like generally jagged alright so now im gonna go back to sharees method of like pinching the hair together and cutting straight across to even it but see look now when i let it go did you see that look look i let it go and then what is that how because it seems like every time i bring my hair together i end up cutting the front part of my hair which is already like the lenght i want and then the back part doesnt end up doing anything you see what im saying and even though sharees has more tricks as to how to even out the back im worried that im gonna keep accidentally cutting the front as well so im just gonna do some point cutting throughout to soften up the edges but beside that im not sure theres really much more i can do at this point i mean listen i actually dont think it looks like too crazy bad right now its just the back that is bad yeah so who can really tell now in the rest of sharees tutorial she basically continues to even it out and then she straightens her hair to show you how it looks and i think in general she seems to do a really good job with her own hair and i think that for me her tutorial definitely worked to a degree i had some fun doing the main choppage and im still pretty impressed by these guys right here but i think in general i may need to seek some professional help for my lump
but for now were just gonna move on to the dye and hope that if i darken evrything up a bit it will be harder to see okay so i went to go take a shower because i was covered in hair and getting very itchy in fact uh my station is still covered in hair and in fact my chair is also covered in hair i dont think i knew this beforehand but it seems that hair is the glitter of body parts bur regardless i have a hair dying video cued up so lets dye making noises meh eh eh eh so this video is called watch me dye my hair and its by mayratouchofglam and to be fair its not exactly a tutorial shes sort of walking through how she dyes her hair but her method seems easy enough and her hair ends up looking pretty good so im on board ive always done my own hair my mom usually helps me dye my hair and today im gonna dye it alone but lets do it alright so the first thing that myra does is that she protects her hairline and her ears so i have this stain barrier cream so im  just gonna put a little bit of this on my finger and then just put it on my hairline whoo oh its thick it feels like elmers glue
i should go around the sideburns i suppose and then the ears are really in danger here alright so her next step is that she pours the entire bottle of hair dye into her little bucket and the dye i have is this demipermanent cream shade in the color  which form what i can tell looks to be about my natural hair colour im not sure how much i need she uses her entire bottle but she also has longer hair than i do oh its white i thought it would be brown is that weird alright and then i match it one to one with the developer alright so now i get take to out my fun brush and start mixing
so it hasnt turned brown yet so im just gonna apply it to my head and hope for the best i mean the box says it was brown basically myras next step is just to section off her hair and start putting it on so i think we should just do that you know what i should really put gloves on so im kind of into the elegance of this brush like i feel very much like hmmm but im worried about covering the whole strand
so i feel like im just kind of like starting with the brush end ending with the hand
i feel like it should look more exciting but its still a light beige colour oh interesting look at what has happened to my ear alright so clearly im going to have to clean off my ears quickly once weve done this whole thing but it seems like it is working alright cool so im gonna let down the rest of my hair and continue to dye slowly to be honest ive been so ready to dye my hair and even though ive like a bizarre carpet growing in the back i feel pretty good about this thats how i feel every day of my life i feel like you know everyone wants to grow up and be like a jim and i grew up and ended up a michael alright so i think im pretty close to being done im just gonna take the last bit of dye on my hands and give my head a final stroke there was like one slighlty grey hair over here that hopefully is covered now well at least he has alright heres to hoping thats enough dye in my hair so im gonna wait another twenty or thirty minutes or so then im gonna go and wash this out and then well check back in and see how it is okay so this is my hair after its been washed and dried and i think that overall im liking the darkness im feeling very midnight in paris i dont know just like a midnight sky or like an inkwell that a writers dipping into with their quill did they still use quills in the  i think that in general the dye job seems to be pretty even i havent found any spots that were conspicuously not dyed yet but you know theres a lot of my head that i cant see so something may turn up
so with the cut and the dyed job done i think that this is like my final results of my personal handiwork i think that in terms of what you guys can see at this moment from the front i think it looks pretty decent but while the front might be an 8 out of   the back is more like a 4 or lower so in light of that i do think i shoud probably get the back cleaned  up a little bit by a professional just so i can you know continue filming videos without everyone commenting what is that on the back of your head so tomorrow im gonna go visit our friend natalie at this or dye salon and she is gonna help me out alright so it is the next morning and we are here at this or dye with natalie alright so basically natalie what i did is that i put my hair into two pigtails and then i just cut across and even though i took it out after and tried to even it out theres a part in the back that started of kind off kind of jagged that i cant really get okay so i definetely see its longe back there you kind of have like a little duck tail the reason why its longer is beacuse you pulled the back to the front so then when you bring it back again thats why its got that rounded shape back there but you know what i mean its not the worse ive seen so thats good so after we showed natalie my handiwork i had  a couple of questions for her so i guess my first question would be if i were to continue cutting my own hair how would i get to the back well it was wet right when you did it no okay and it worked for the person in the youtube video her hair ended up looking pretty good and it was short like yours it wasnt as short as mine right well thats why its harder to cut as well because its shorter in the back we came to that conclusion after we did it so per natalie if i were to continue this haircut on my own i should start off with a handheld mirror thats my first really good look at it first what i would do is do your hair wet bacause thats how you gonna get the straightest but even with these suggestions natalie was skeptical that you could really pull it off on your own especially at this length i just dont think it would be ever perfectly straight so it seems hard its very hard she aslo noted that my hair was probably a little thick for a two pigtail approach you have a lot of hair so if your hair was finer i think it would have been easier thats what i was encountering too because i think her pigtails were a bit like thinner so when she was sort of trimming  she didnt get like stuck exactly but of course hindsight is  unless i guess youre trying to see the back of your head we can definitely help you out today though
i could leave the front though if you want me that could be your haircut and mine will be in the back yeah see we could do a half and a half  teamwork now i think we were natalies first customers to get ourselves into this predicament following a youtube tutorial but we werent her first athome haircute fix and though there were was no wine involved in our decision it probably would have been a better excuse the front was good the front was like a 8 the back was like a 3 alright thats pretty similar to what we said so after evening out the whole situation natalie also blowdried and flat ironed my hair so  it looked nice and styled almost as if i had gotten a real haircut damn it ty thats funny and despite tylers constant shrek references i think we were liking it this looks very professional yes like the dark and the cut and the angle oh you mean professional like a look like a business professional yeah i mean you just look like i dont know someone to take serious i am i am someone to take seriously cut back to uaaaah awesome well thank you so much natalie for helping us  we needed some help it wasnt so bad so bad emphasis on so alright so this is my cutbymebutfixedbyaprofessional haircut overall i would say the good thing is that i like my hair as it is right now im a pretty big fan of the bouncy length and i feel like ill get a good amount of mileage out of this haircut as in like i feel like itll be a length that i like for a long time and im also a pretty big fan of the color im glad were back to dark and i know that this color even though its a little big darker than my old hair color will fade over time but i also like it like this i feel like edna mode but maybe a bit taller and maybe less slaphappy
so with these youtube tutorials i think i did a better job with the dye than with the cut but we werent so far gone that natalie couldnt salvage it so it wasnt a complete hair fail all in all though i had a pretty good time and i do actually think i learned a few things and though im not sure my experience will inspire anyone to do this at home if you are gonna give these tutorials a go i would probably recommend that you do more of a trim than like a true style change like i went for or if you want to do the full monty just be prepared to get it fixed thank you guys so much for watching

i was wearing at the beginning of this video you can get it right now at fiendsbysafcom as well as other things if you want those also were making a mug dont tell anyone here are my social media handles and a big shoutout to didi thanks for watchin didi and ill see you guys a next time ♫  ♫ hello friends and welcome to another video today im gonna be mixing every eyeshadow from every online beauty gurus eyeshadow palettes together so ive mixed a lot of my own makeup in the past and ive also previously melted together every lipstick from sephora to get a frankenlipstick that was meant to uncover the average shade of all of the lipsticks that are sold in their stores or i suppose the midpoint color of what sephora thinks is a marketable lipstick to their clientele now im guessing that most of you as youtube viewers know what a beauty guru is but just to propose a definition im referring to online creators and influencers who make beautyrelated content and within that usually recommend specific makeup products and provide tutorials as to how to achieve certain makeup looks now these days a lot of beauty gurus produce their own makeup products either via their own company or by collabing with an established cosmetics brand and if i had to say what the most common beauty guru makeup product is it would definitely be an eyeshadow palette so following the logic from my sephora lipsticks video if i were to mix together every eyeshadow shade from every beauty gurus palette i would hypothetically come up with a midpoint shadow that would represent the most beautygururecommended color once again its not great science in fact its not even good its bad makeup science but i guess thats why its the name of the series now a couple of caveats before we begin first off for this video we are only going to be using palettes that are currently still in production or at least were very recently in like the last six months or so this ensures that in case a gurus taste has changed were presenting their most current recommendation we also focused on gurus who to my knowledge got their start online and more specifically are youtubers but even with those constraints there wasnt like a master list of beauty guru makeup products out there so we may have missed a palette or two so no shade to anyone if we missed them but i think as long as our sample size is large enough a couple of palettes shouldnt change our final result now speaking of shade i do realize there have been some uh goingson in the beauty community recently in fact i started ordering these palettes in july attempted to film this video in august then stuff happened so i decided to postpone since then more things have happened and i realized that theres probably never gonna be a good time to do this so were doing it now just so everyone knows every person who i know of who could be considered a youtube beauty gurus palette is in this video i am not attempting to judge anyones character nor am i attempting to review the quality of these palettes im just interested in what colors are in there and how many of them there are no shade only science so with all that said lets whip out the palettes i feel like with them all laid out like this its almost like the game of thrones intro where you have like a topographical map of westeros where are my dragons i dont want to start anything so im not going to say who id put at kings landing fly you fools in the game of gurus you either win or you die here for the tea just gets to behead you with the shard from a lipfiller no its very dull it will take a while all right so to actually begin why dont we start off with jaclyn hills many palettes so to honor the source material of this video we decided to mix everything in this clear teacup but this is a teacup of healing hopefully or at least of just forced togetherness and the process im going to do is im basically just going to scrape a little bit of each of these eyeshadows into this teacup and then once weve scraped a bit of every single eyeshadow from every single one of these palettes im going to use this fixy makeup repair kit that i got to turn it into one eyeshadow so without further ado lets get to scraping oh i havent done one of these in a while ha ha hah  ha ha ha ha ha ha ha now this morphe jaclyn hill palette is actually the only palette that was also featured in my mixing all of my eyeshadows together video from last year so um shes already been through something all right ready tyler yeah careful careful just a bit off the top oh yes yes and then once weve scraped its time to dump all right now that weve popped the cherry we just have to keep going cause there are a lot of eyeshadows and sixtynine palettes left unintentional but good number oh my god thats a softy listen i love me some asmr my current favorite video is this one where a girl roleplays as a medieval nun who is taking care of you while you have the plague angelica ummm you are sick … with the bubonic plague so sowwy i dont think ive every made it to the end i always fall asleep all right so im on my last row now ive started wiping off my scalpel on my pants in between shadows so i guess later on well have some leg checkins as well as our tea checkins so besides her like og morphe palette jaclyn also has four vault palettes shes got a purpletoned one a mustardycolored one a rosyhued one and a sort of like smokyblue one these ones also have the shade names on the palettes which i appreciate because then i get to see what they are named like these ones are hush hush and bling bling and theyre about to get scrape scraped sounds like im saying crêpes crêpes i could totally go for a crêpe theres also a color called shhh and a color called bomb ass which sounds kind of dangerous honestly ready for some pour porn or as i like to call it  pourn one good thing about a small palette is you have sort like a narrow dump all right so this is our final jacky hill color ooooooooooooooooooo it was moooooooooooorphecom im sorry that was so stupid but anyway i guess thats one guru down so as we move along the other element im interested in investigating is what the average composition of a beauty guru palette is like how many shades are in there are they neutrals or are they bold colors and if theyre mattes shimmers or glitters i like shiny things im sort of like a pigeon in that way so as we go digging and scraping from guru to guru— oh yes oh my god oh its so soft oh im going too deep oh my god —im going to be calling out some stats to tyler so at the end we can calculate the hypothetical most common beauty guru palette i like your pencil tyler thank you i also like your fiends longsleeve tshirt sorry back to the video okay so next up with have kandee johnsons collab palette with too faced which is called i want kandee you know kind of like aaron carter circa  and it does kind of smell like candy ♫ i want shavings ♫ tyler ♫ da dada dadat dat dat ♫ and thats how i beat shaq i was trying to catapult them in tyler successfully and then next up we have a bunch of collab palettes from the company makeup revolution which i believe is a british company so theyre mostly like ukbased creators except for the emily edit palettesi think shes from illinois as am i so whats good emily how about them bears i dont think theyre doing particuarly well but… theyre not doing that bad hey there you go so after some of these revolution palettes the mixture is looking quite vibrant almost looks like flaming hot cheeto dust which you wouldnt think youd want to put on your eyes but right now i kind of do coincidentally my pant leg is also looking quite nice dont you mean thighdye so with this final sprinkle ill clean up these palettes later dont worry all right so i feel like it makes sense because we just did revolution beauty which is a ukbased company to push on and do some palettes from creators of the commonwealth so we have a tanya burr palette whos from the uk waaah weve got a couple from chloe morello whos from australia
tyler ooo safiya did that make it in its just luck every time and one from shaaanxo who i believe is a kiwi aka from new zealand so the fun thing about the shaaanxo palette is that its doublesided you have like one palette here and then it goes this way
tyler ohhh see its kind of like how the toilets flush the other way in the southern hemisphere they also have doublesided eyeshadow palettes now i think thats all the commonwealth creators though we may have missed a canadian or two theyre just harder to sniff out then next up because we just did a pixi palette and a bh cosmetics palette i have more pixi and more bh cosmetics from itsjudytime itsmyrayeraye and carli bybel itsmyrayerayes is also another one that has like multiple panels and when i balance it on my cup it sort of looks like a beach chair which felt like it was something to note for some reason and then we have carli bybels palette which to me kind of looks like a roman bathhouse like weve got some marble some pools some sort of decorative tiles well theres a lot of nudes in there okay with all of those done were nearing like the midway point of the eyeshadows the palette pile is quite formidable and our eyeshadow mound is rising so up next i have five eyeshadow quads from patrick starrr in collaboration with mac and they come in a variety of different colors and i think theyre usually released like with a set of other makeup whered this outfit come from and this turban golly gee i think im turning into patrick starrr do you think that patrick starrr is just a really big spongebob fan who got there first patrick starrr or patrick star well get there in a second i will say though that patrick starrr is the only guru who has me on pr so … snaps palette shut thats the real tea although im not really sure why anyone would want to send me pr after they see what is done to the makeup that is sent to me but the point still stands thanks for the pr patrick call me all right so now im just going to finish up the influencerbrand collabs starting with the colourpop palettes of which i have one from makeupshayla two from eva gutowski one from iluvsarahii and two from kathleen lights now thinking back to the pr point im actually pretty sure i do get kathleen lightss colourpop pr in which case thank you to kathleen as well however i dont have a kathleen costume sorry for this round im also bringing this maybelline city mini palette by makeupshayla as well just so the shayla ones can go together you think this is a onedumper i think it could be i call this one six colors one cup dear shayla im sorry its a very pretty palette so with that were done with colourpop and also the shayla addendum of this lil thing so we have five more influencerbrand palettes starting with two from kristen leanne and urban decay now i was going to say that kristen leanne was kind of contributing to the neutralness of our eyeshadow… stew i guess but her second palette is like all bright colors in all differently shaped pans i feel like its trying to tell me something almost like morse code you know like lines and dots its like national treasure but for beauty gurus its been in the palette the whole time we also have one from aspyn ovard and tarte one from melisa michelle and ulta and one from nicol concilio and violet voss which is holo biiitch so adding that to my very precarious pile now were on to palettes by makeup gurus who run their own lines like laura lee and manny  ♫  ♫ everyone breathe   and christen dominique too and shes got her latte palette and her lemonade palette she also fortunately or unfortunately has dc carved into each of her shadows which we are about to mess up theyre marvel eyeshadows now ha ha ha ha ha and then next up we have four palettes from jeffree star androgyny beauty killer thirsty and blood sugar and he of course also has like an engraving in his eyeshadows that is about to be bulldozed actually could we just pause for second i feel like were going through this way too fast were just blowing through all these eyeshadow palettes maybe we should split up this video into like five parts maybe even eight …
tyler oooooo … if necessary like we could call the first one the truth behind mixing every beauty gurus eyeshadow palette together and then we could call the next one the secret behind mixing every beauty gurus eyeshadow palette together and then in the third one i could live like an eyeshadow palette for a day yeah im just kidding no shade at all to shane or jeffree in fact im very much looking forward to the illuminati palette and i can only hope that its taco bell scented okay so after those palettes were actually nearing the end of our scraping journey in fact we only have two gurus left so our penultimate brand is makeup geek which is run by marlena stell and its a little bit different from some of the other beauty guru brands because its not just her name but she is a beauty youtuber so shes here and then our final final guru is huda kattan aka huda beauty or as tyler likes to call her tyler cannot say huda beauty to be fair its difficult to say now huda like a couple of the other gurus that we have in this stack i think is like primarily an instagram creator i know she also has a facebook watch show  i  i think but she does of course have a youtube channel so i felt like with like all of the elements together she should be on this list also as we touched on before her brand name is pretty great chanted huda booty huda booty rockin everywhere as they say all right so after twelve huda palettes were finally on to our last one this is all thats standing in between me and sleep right now so lets wreck it were ending with an orange yeah ill take it all right let me put this atop this precarious pile and lets survey our mixture shall we so in the end we had seventy palettes from thirty different gurus so many dumps were had on this paper look how bad my aim was with a total of  individual eyeshadows giving the average palette about eleven shades all right ive pierced the middle oh its deep so in our mixture as well as in our average palettes we had  neutral colors and  colorful colors oh wow i just saw a crusty hair in there let me procure it with  of those colors being purple  being pink  blue  orange  green 9 red and 6 yellow so even though actual red shades arent super common it seems like variants on red like purple pink and orange are very popular and all of that leaves our mixture looking like this and our average beauty guru palette looking something like this oh and also we found that  of the shadows were mattes  were shimmer shades and 6 were glitters also represented in our theoretical palette here so i think that now that we have this mixture maybe we should just bust out the fixy kit and see what happens so with the fixy kit you first grind your shadows through the sifter as its going through the grinder its starting to look like very metallic like im seeing some shimmer up here after that you pour your shadow grounds into the pan you want to use and give it three to four spritzes of this sort of handsanitizerscented stuff all right one more just for fun aah
tyler ooh yeah okay i did a little bit more than recommended but i want it to be strong now i have to place this lid firmly over it and press for—oh i should be standing up—press for ten seconds then after that we just lift up the lid  eeehh
tyler eeh … and we have our eyeshadow ta daaaah hello frankenguru and welcome to the world ive birthed an eyeshadow it smells like alcohol first impressions on how it looks in my hand ifs it definitely looks warmer and browner than the shadow we made when we mixed just my personal eyeshadows last year but similarly to that one i am seeing a lot of shimmer in there as well as some multicolored speckles if you look close enough so the fixy kit does say that you can use your newly pressed shadow in like just a few minutes but im going to let it dry overnight because weve been mixing for hours and im about to pass out so im going to put my frankenguru shadow right here and then tomorrow when we eventually awake i will return swatch it and wear it all day but in the meantime well place her here so she can sit upon the pigment throne all right so its the next day and our shadow is looking dry and ready to apply a pimple has also sprung up on my nose to join us in this journey so welcome pimple all right so this is how its looking this morning i think its looking like slightly more purple and burgundyish than it was last night it does however still look more brown than the frankenshadow that i made last year so this is what the swatch looks like in full sunlight both saf and tyler oooooo its quite sparkly and its sort of like a rosy copper shade and then in inside light the swatch looks like this less sparkly and more of like a penny color all right lets put it on so im just going to put some eye primer on just to give this eyeshadow a fighting chance ooooh it is showing up very quickly i think with the last frankenshadow i did have to like build it up a little bit and this one i would say is more pigmented i think it does work pretty well as like an overall lid shade and in general indoors without sunlight it does look sort of just like a flattering warm rosy taupey brown i hope that wasnt too many descriptors but thats sort of how i feel about it so im just going to finish up my makeup really quick and cover up our friend sir pimple dame pimple judy pimple and then well check back in okay so this is my finished makeup look i think that actually this frankenguru all over the lid with the rest of my makeup looks kind of dramatic like i feel kind of like dramatic eyepop but used more sparingly and perhaps with less of like a cateye wing i think it would come off more subtle so now that my makeup is on were going to go outside see how the shadow looks in different lighting and then were going to do a few different activities including looking for a dupe at sephora and also looking at the shadow under a microscope all right lets go tyler ooooo ohh the sun is bright tyler right in the eyes sorry about that oh its real shimmery i feel like a cat in the sun or a raisin either or thats a poetry joke i also apologize for that im going to make an apology video after this tyler yeah but this apology video will be just failed jokes alright so now that weve seen it out in the sunlight and ive slightly damaged my retinas lets go to sephora and see if we can find a similar shade so im just going to swatch the frankenguru on my hand to aid us in our dupe finding quest there are a lot of dupe candidates because its just a neutral shimmer but its also kind of quietly unique because its in between purple and brown and also in between matte and like a true metallic i guess its sort of a satin so its tricky to match actually as you can see from the numerous swatches on my hand we also have a swatch from crusty right here tyleroh yeah tylerwe need to trim his nails all right so after a decent amount of swatching i came up with four like finalists that i think are pretty close but out of the four the winner for me is this shade right here which is a dior backstage shadow called shimmer purple in a palette called cool neutrals so i guess dior thinks this is a cool neutral purple shimmer which isnt what i would call it but  its a pretty good dupe okay so were at home a few hours later and i thought it was high time for more science so i brought out my trusty microscope just so we could take a closer look at what weve got going on here  okay so im just going to swatch it on my arm and then well see what we can see oooohoo interesting oh wow you totally can see a lot of different colors under the microscope come look i can see some sort of like brown particles in the cracks in my skin but with the shimmer thats coating my scales you can see a lot of different colored glitter look you can see like  an orange and a blue and a pink all these things you cant see with the naked eye but with science you can see it tylerscience aka a  microscope from amazon so as a bonus comparison im going to swatch the og frankenshadow next to it just so we can see the difference oh interesting okay so this shadow is obviously much older than the frankenguru actually i think its almost exactly a year old tylerthis is sorta like the one year anniversary aww and when i look at it under the microscope i do see a few different colour pigments but i would say that im seeing less different flecks overall i feel like its sort of more frosted and less multicolored i think partially because the gurus had more different colored glitters than i did in my personal collection and i theorize that the glitter chunks are what were seeing here alright so its been quite a few hours so i think its time to wrap up our day wearing our frankenguru eyeshadow i would say that overall it wore pretty well like it still looks quite good on the eyes and in terms of the color i do think it is a nice color though i will say i wasnt surprised when it turned out to be like a warm shimmery brown just because of how many neutrals and variations on red went into the mix and i think that the strong representation of those colors may just be because neutrals and rosy tones are easy to wear for a lot of people though i do sort of suspect and wonder if theres some like color theory to it just because ive seen things about how fast food restaurants and restaurants in general will choose like red and yellow and other warm colors for their logos because that makes people feel hungry and more likely to go in so i wonder if perhaps the same thing might happen on like social media like a warmtoned look might make people you know feel sort of cosy and ready to like of course thats just a hypothesis i dont know a lot about color theory but it sounds plausible so just to truly put a cap on our day i thought it would be only appropriate to make one more tea joke tyleroh my god so i bought some empty tea bags with which to make some frankenguru tea its sort of like stone soup but not all right so im going to boil the water so the tea is hot should i leave room for milk both no see this feels like one of those things where like someone shouldve stopped me before we got to this point tyleryeah i think hes sitting behind the camera right now he he heh all right so ive let the tea steep for a couple of minutes so ah here we go cheers to the gurus ooo it tastes like chalk but you know not too bad actually sort of a  a bad feeling in the back of my mouth like im feeling a little bit of like a powder back there but all in all id take another sip do you think this is bad for me tylermost likely mmm valid okay so that is the frankenguru eyeshadow obviously this time around i dont have like a lot of them to give away but i would still like to hear your guyss name suggestions in the comments

big shoutout to carly for watching thanks for watching carly and i will see you guys anext time i just wanted to show everyone what happened when i took the tea bag out to dry it made this face on the paper towel i think i may just have exorcised the angry pacman out of the beauty community or its just a tea bag i dont know you decide hello friends and welcome to another video today im going to be trying out questionable photo and video hacks from instagram now previously weve tried recreating some odd sort of silent movieesque beauty and fashion hacks that are all over instagram with pretty mediocre results and since then weve stumbled upon yet another bizarre family of howto videos photo and video hacks which are meant to teach you how to take artistic likebait instagram photos as well as uniquely edited videos that will have you going aviral now while some of these hacks and videos are kind of cute a lot of them seem to fall into the isthatevengood and the theresnowaythatworks categories theres also sort of an intriguing metaness to these hacks where theyre trying to get views on instagram by teaching people how to get views on instagram so theyre able to justify using a clickbaity thumbnail because theyre teaching you how to clickbait now overall i would say these videos are still in the early stages of being produced as theyre not quite yet as spammed to the masses as say beauty tutorials or clothing hacks but mark my words the flood is coming as the few that we have found on instagram or reposted to youtube have ridiculously high view counts and usually with these instagram hack videos once there is blood in the water there tend to be many copysharks ready to hack at the chum so i thought it would be fun to jump on this bandwagon and try some out myself but before we dive in i also wanted to let you guys know that we just launched our first merch drop  clothing line which is called fiends by saf or i guess by me which includes this shirt im wearing right here as well as few others weve shown on instagram but well show you the whole line at the end of the video also no theres no relation to best fiends all right lets get to hacking now from watching a few of these videos on instagram but also versions that were reposted onto youtube and facebook i would say that there a few different categories that these hacks fall into and the first category that were going to tackle is the forced perspective hack now i would define forced perspective as kind of like optical illusions where you can make your subject seem bigger or smaller or at a different angle in relation to the objects around them to create a titillating image i feel like the classic example of this is the holdingup theleaningtowerofpisa photo and these hackers love this trick whether it be a watermelon dress falling off the side of the sidewalk ahem blowing dudes off your hand popping out of a chapstick holder or tricking women on tinder into thinking you have a lambo which is the subject of an extended playout in this video by crafty panda but the hack were gonna be taking on is the classic tiny woman jumping into teacup so this video was posted by diylearning but it was freebooted from inute crafts and this version has like  million views which is sort of disappointing because inute crafts original posted video only has  million views freebooting wins again on instagram so basically for this hack it seems that you need two people a mug a rock and some water  and also a camera tyler definitely that saf so basically you have one person whos like really close to the mug with the camera and then you have another person who is the fallee who jumps and then compresses to pretend to have jumped into the cup once that happens the person whos holding the camera drops the rock into the cup to create a little splash and then afterwards you edit out the rock so you just see the jump and the splash so for this hack and i guess most of these hacks were gonna have to go out into the world so i guess well go out try it out and see what happens tyler you gotta compact jump saf saf so we headed out to a park where we found a picnic bench that i could stand on top of and then jump off of and we tried a few test shots without the rock just to make sure like tyler could get the cup lined up properly for that real forced perspective tyler oh okay that looks pretty good saf and also to perfect my jumping technique which we quickly found out was bad tyler you gotta condense faster saf i cant i dont know how oh like this tyler yeah you gotta frogsquat tyler no thats really slow saf once we introduced the water and the rock though we quickly found out that its difficult to both hold the camera and also drop the rock  saf how was that tyler i missed saf so to solve this problem we had one of our editors emily drop the rock i feel like that sounds weird for some reason tyler it sounds like shes taking a dump saf so tyler could just focus on the cinematography tyler this is like a michael bay film tyler okay youre dancing on the side of a pool saf im warm i wanna take a dip in this teacup tyler dont make a tea joke saf im swimming in tea tyler god damn it saf and with our new setup we got some better results tyler oh sht tyler no your heads popping up you gotta go back down tyler yeah there you go saf we tried a couple of different angles and actually a couple of different park benches and in the end we came away with at least a few usable takes although there was one squirrel who didnt seem to think i was doing a very good job all right something just hit my head that was rude unfortunately for him there is no such thing as a dislike on instagram tyler ah there he is being a little bitch saf overall i would say that the experience of making this hack was pretty  medium you definitely need more people and more hands on set than they insinuate and i also think that with most of these forced perspective hacks its hard to get both the close object and the far object in focus at the same time in fact i would say that a lot of the finished products in these hacks almost look like theyre photoshopped together however i do think that this hack ended up looking kind of cute though it probably would have been cuter if i were better at jumping tyler have you ever jumped into like a swimming pool saf yes but this is not jumping into a swimming pool im jumping onto concrete so overall i would say that i wasnt very good at doing this hack but this definitely isnt the worst hack on the list so the next category i would call prop hacks as in theyre basically just telling you what props to use or what backgrounds to make so your photos just look more interesting and these can range from using crumpled up tinfoil to taping flowers to a piece of saran wrap to posing suggestively with mirrors or even pretending youre being kidnapped i guess woman in photo how did i happen to get here saf once again were all out here playing checkers and troom troom is i dont know playing jenga or something and these prop hacks are contained within the larger category of just teaching people how to take better photos like stand up straight pull back your leg fat etc etc but the hack were going to be doing is a singingintherainesque hack with a water bottle and an umbrella so this video is another inute crafts video and it is basically just that you take an umbrella with a little sort of spoke at the top open up a water bottle upend the water bottle on top of the spoke and sort of let the water like flow down as if its raining and then you kind of like pose underneath the umbrella to be like oh my god its sunny and raining at the same time tyler whaaat saf all right so weve got a clear plastic umbrella and a water bottle tyler yeah
saf right thats all we need saf all right ready tyler yeah you gotta twirl gotta twirl saf over the shoulder tyler yeah go yeah go its on oh hold on tyler  there we go i rotated midshot saf its hitting my head so we figured out pretty quickly that the top of our umbrella was pretty much the exact same size as the opening of our water bottle is anything coming out here help tyler  water bottles full saf so tyler kept having to lift the water bottle up to give me a spurt here and there oh hohohoo im really wet oh im really wet okay tyler at least were watering the grass
saf yeah  saf so we wanted to try something with a bigger nozzle and coincidentally we happened to have an empty odwalla bottle that we filled up with water saf ready tyler go tyler  ooooh wow its raining saf and it definitely did work almost too well is it empty oh crap that was it saf how was that
tyler that was fast saf so once again we had to employ the help of emily saf uuuh ready so tyler could be ready with the camera good tyler i think so saf was that better tyler i think so saf all right ehhh we tried that like five times overall i would say that the end product of this hack is kind of fun but i think it is actually sort of difficult to execute how do i twirl this umbrella well over one shoulder oh im getting wet and when i really think about it i wonder what the purpose of the hack is its kind of cute i just dont know like if we instagram that like what would someone say be like its not its not raining how are you doing that tyler why is that good saf im not sure if it hinges on the idea that its interesting that its raining while its sunny or if theyre just putting any prop in your hands to spice up your feed like hey maybe you havent taken a picture with an umbrella in a while ha ha ha that was fun okay so our next category is what i would call the equipment hacks as in how do you enhance your current equipment or simulate the effect of having fancier equipment within this category there are a few hacks that focus on how to play with lighting like making a bounce light with a big mac box using a cd for a rainbow effect or using a pasta strainer to get like a dappled light there are also some that focus on camera stabilization of which a couple seem okay but others seem very dangerous like rolling down a street in your office chair or using a belt to swing your hundredsofdollars camera around this one makes me very upset please dont do this but the subcategory were looking into is the puttingstuffonyourlens genre which includes using things like lipstick chapstick water or for a less destructive approach pantyhose sunglasses or a constructionpaper cutout of a heart which is the one were gonna be trying now we actually found this hack in a few different places in a few different compilations from different diy conglomerates but just for like our purposes right now were gonna be comping off of this video posted by blossom so i believe this is called a heart bokeh effect and basically what they instruct you to do is literally just take like a constructionpaper circle cut out a heart in the middle and then place it over your lens and then you should basically be able to direct your lens at anything with christmas lights in the background and turn those christmas lights into hearts now admittedly there are some holes in my dslr knowledge but even so i feel like there has to be something more to this however there are no further instructions in like any of these hack videos about this and also for other hacks they touch on things like changing the settings on your camera whereas for this hack they say nothing of the sort apparently construction paper is fricking magic all right so basically im just supposed to trace the circumference of my lens onto a piece of construction paper and then sometimes they like trace a heart in the middle but im gonna do the like foldinhalfandcreateaheartthatway method this is some serious secondgradeish i feel like an oldschool cartoon im like hubba hubba so once we had our heart filter cut out i realized pretty quickly that there was something more to this that i did not know wait  tyler what saf what tyler it doesnt look right saf no youre just in a heart basically with all of the settings on my camera the same as they are right now putting a heart filter over the lens just puts a heart over the picture this looks terrible so determined to give it the old college try i ended up watching a couple of youtube tutorials on how to do the bokeh effect i love this question how do i get the most bokeh and it seems to be pretty hard so i messed with the settings on my camera a little bit and tried to get some distance between me and the christmas lights and have tyler far enough in front of the christmas lights so i could really get them out of focus youre too close tyler oh im too close all right saf youre too close and i even changed out my lens for a zoom lens and even with all of these adjustments i didnt really get it to work okay i can get the background lights to look like hearts if im zoomed in and looking only at them but i cant get any hearts with tyler also in frame also tyler looks like sort of like a tomato demon because hes so like not lit heh so overall in reviewing this hack i do not think it works i think that bokeh is a real thing and like a real technique and im probaby not pronouncing it right but this hack is just lying maybe one day i will learn to bokeh but not today so the next category is the transition category and there actually arent a ton of these on instagram yet but there are some and i think theyre mostly based on the musically or i guess its called tiktok nowtransition style and i would say their signature element is the moving of the phone to create the effect like sliding your phone in a certain direction or flipping it upside down etc etc and the hack that were going to be doing comes from our megafreebooted inute crafts compilation and they basically sort of create this story where someone comes in stomps on the ground and then someone on the other side of the world is listening to that person stomp on the ground above them i guess it sort of feels like an instagram version of the dig a hole to china thing  and basically the technique that you do with your phone is that you film someone stomping on the ground and then you lower your phone like below a stair flip your phone around and then raise your phone up and by the time you sort of come up theres someone else there listening in the spot where that person was just stomping so lets go find some stairs and try this out also for this one they use a second person but im just going to be stomping and listening tyler yeah youre on both sides of the world i guess saf yeah its the upside down tyler ohhhh saf so we tried this one quite a few times and i think it is kind of tricky to like get all of the elements together  tyler i dont think i gave you enough time saf like you need a steady hand whilst holding the camera you need to be fully below the stair before you start flipping you need to make sure the subject is changing position at the right time etc etc tyler this is really hard tyler im not good at this one saf i dont think im that good saf i need to hit the deck really fast tyler yeah you gotta speed it up saf but after numerous takes and quite a bit of awkwardlooking stomping i dont know why im so bad at stomping and jumping and like anything to do with legs we ended up with a few decent takes i think that was great tyler okay cool
saf yeah saf leaving me hanging thats rude now in terms of postproduction i think that they basically intend for you to edit out the whole flipping time as you can see like in their footage there is no flip but i feel like theyve done something a little more because not only can i not see a jumpcut in their footage their stair is also very smooth and much darker than the one they show themselves filming in front of so i dont know what they did but they did something to make it look really good in conclusion i do think that their finished product is pretty cool but following their tutorial as stated our version doesnt really measure up all stomping issues aside all right so our final category is what i would call just editing though some of these other hacks also require editing to achieve the final product these ones specifically require nothing else besides cutting out some footage or playing something backwards now some of these seem to be like stopmotion animation which definitely does require some effort to edit but overall this category is basically just like hey have you heard of adobe premiere so our hack that were gonna be doing is also from inute crafts but it is from a different photoandvideohack compilation now this one is very simple its essentially just walking backwards but you play it backwards so it looks like youre walking forwards and everyone around you is like walking the other direction so youre like going against the grain of society youre a free spirit andor you probably dont live in new york or somewhere where someone would just barrel right into you but it seems straightforward enough so were going to head out to somewhere in la that has some foot traffic and see what we can do all right  so we decided to come to hollywood because we thought that you know there are people walking around here but it seems like people are more milling than walking with purpose tyler yeah saf and there also wasnt really continuous traffic there were more sort of like lulls and waves tyler theres no one there saf damn it so even though i had like a few good stretches of walking backwards there were plenty of times where there just like wasnt anyone around me you zoomed in on my feet but there was no one elses feet to compare me to tyler oh was that what i was supposed to do saf yeah tyler okay i didnt really get the memo saf we tried a few different takes of this going different directions on the street waiting for foot traffic to sort of catch up to etc etc weve got one more crowd of people coming ready but i feel like the biggest tells with this hack is if people walk the same direction as you or if you have to dodge them tyler youre gonna walk into peoplegotta veer left tyler there you go saf the girl in the video is able to maintain like a very straight gait which makes me feel like the people around her were perhaps extras i know there was at least one guy in the video that we see in other hacks so im not saying that like everyone else in the video was an extra but like maybe they had a few strategic people so they could have some good traffic and also some good straight lines tyler the one thing you cant do is look over your shoulder you cant just go  tyler im walking that way saf now overall i think that there were a couple of good moments in what we filmed but with how many challenges this one has and how difficult it is to look natural walking backwards i woudnt say theres a lot of payoff to this hack and i think that this category in general is definitely the longest stretch on the word hack because i feel like hacks are supposed to be neat tricks or quickandeasy fixes and this is more take footage put it into editing software edit it  and thats literally it okay so those were our instagram photo and video hacks i think that overall my favorites out of these hacks were the jumpingintothecup hack and the umbrella hack just because we did have some fun filming them and also because the ending products were something at least on the other side of the spectrum i feel like the walkingbackwards hack is probably the least hacklike of any of the hacks weve done in any of these videos and i think the heartbokeh hack was probably the leastinformative hack weve ever tried now as for whether or not they achieve their supposed objective of getting you more likes im not  sure that they would but i think that perhaps the more straightforward tips about teaching you how to pose may actually be helpful especially if youve never heard of those before while other ones may just confuse your followers and in some cases they may even make them worry for your safety troom troom eyes full of horror and imitate a cry of despair but hey even if these hacks wont necessarily help you go aviral they may help you get a date on tinder as long as they never ask to see the actual car tyler gotcha saf thank you guys so much for watching and as we mentioned before we just launched our merch line which i decided to call fiends because i feel like fiend is the like word embodiment of this handmotion right here which is kind of like sneaky mischievous and hoarding of many lipsticks amongst other things  as for the items we have this fiends longsleeve tshirt which ive been wearing pretty much for the last week straight and besides that we also have a bat btch hoodie and a hello friends tshirt as well as a beanie a dad hat and some pretty neat pins and stickers now in general this is like our very first drop of anything ever so were definitely still figuring some things out and learning as we go i feel like weve been saying the word merch a lot but were sort of actually going for something in between merch and a clothing line because we wanted to make stuff that would be wearable in your everyday life beyond just repping saf we also wanted to make sure the items were pretty good quality so like the hello friends tshirt is embroidered if i can find it its embroidered and with the sweatshirt we went for a bit of a nicer hoodie apparently its a good cotton mix just so you guys could get some good use out of them now that said based on the feedback that weve gotten from you guys in the last couple of days were definitely going to be adding some more plussize options but besides that just go take a look check it out and see if youre into it and just know that we have a bunch of ideas for future drops and were gonna be adding some different products at different pricepoints as well the link to the shop is right here as well as in the description below so yay thanks again for watching if you like that video i dont always plug my merch so please shmash that like button and it you want to see more videos like this make sure to shmash that subscribe button here are my social media handles and a big shoutout to emerald for watching thanks for watching emerald and i will see you guys anext time hello friends and welcome to another video today were gonna be testing products from companies that asked to sponsor me not sponsored so as you guys may know many youtubers including myself will from time to time make videos that are sponsored by a company or product and for our part weve done five on this channel now from what i know these youtuberbrand relationships can come through a variety of sources a manager an mcn and in our case we source through our agent but besides those avenues there is also the wild west of brand relationships the business email where well receive random solicitations from companies who want to sponsor a video or instagram post provide affiliate links or send us some free products to review etc etc and im pretty sure that a lot of youtubers experience this  somebody just emailed me and asked me to promote their product in exchange for twenty thousand dollars in their cryptocurrency that they expect will take off by spring   safiya in fact on more than one occasion weve received reachouts that were spammed to like thirtyplus youtuber business emails and weve also received messages sent to the wrong creator as well as about a thousand emails addressed hello dear now no shade at all to the hustle as i know a lot of these companies are just businesses trying to get off the ground and some of their products can be quite intriguing such as electric nail drills sexy lingerie and silicone shampoo brushes amongst many many many others that said the main reason we havent worked with any of these coldcall brands isnt because they dont email us correctly in fact its kind of funny when that happens its mostly because i dont know enough about these companies or products to feel comfortable promoting them even if i do find myself sometimes wanting to try them so i thought it would be fun to go through my business email and to find four examples of some interesting products notsponsoredorder them and try them out and i guess see if we should have hypothetically taken the sponsorship andor endorsed them all right lets dive right in now tyler and id prevetted these reachouts so we went through like a ton of these emails dating all the way back to march of this year and we chose a few strong candidates i think so lets jump right into the first product which is a japanese subscription box so this company is called zenpop and it appears to be a japanbased company that sells subscription boxes with japanese snacks and also beauty products inside of them so im pretty sure the reason that they reached out to me is because we did that threepart japan series earlier this year in fact they say you do a lot of japanrelated videos which isnt wrong and luckily for them im also interested in snacks so its a good venn diagram of just japan content snacks and um beauty products too so what they want is to sponsor me to do an unboxingtype of video on my youtube channel which is a pretty popular request we just wouldnt want to do an unboxing that was sponsored by the company itself so it looks like on their website they actually have a few different kinds of boxes like a candy box ramen and candy mixed together ramen only beauty and stationery i think in general im leaning more towards the snacks because we did recently do a japanese beauty products haul and in terms of the stationery i actually dont write a lot of things with a pen and paper nowadays i live my entire life inside of a computer so why dont we go for the combo japanese ramen and sweets mix pack just to get a little variety ah my first instinct was to do a onetime purchase just for this video but it turns out thats sold out so instead i have to subscribe for at least three months i guess thats  on japanese snacks and noodles so for our second product i chose this app called the wifi map and i will say that their subject line really just jumped out at me it reads wifi map  youtube  video with  views guaranteed now i dont know if that means that they just believe their product is super interesting and will garner  views or if theyre just willing to buy views for me but either way i think it definitely deserved an open so from what i can tell this product is basically like a crowdsourced map of like different wifis that you can connect to it seems to be like people sort of contributing their own personal wifi to the list or if they perhaps like know the password to a local coffee shops wifi they might put it on the map as well now they dont really explain why they reached out to me specifically nor do they say exactly what they want but it does seem like people are generally interested in this app as am i honestly so im gonna download this app to my phone and then when we get all of the rest of our haul items well try this out irl just wander around and see if we can just get on peoples home wifis i guess so next up is our third product which is the sitpack so the sitpack seems to be like a telescoping portable seat but you can unfurl and it will turn into like a little stool that you can sit on that you can use while waiting in lines or for the subway or whatever and when youre done you can just refurl it into a little sodacanshaped looking thing now they alluded to wanting a youtube review though they dont exactly like hit the nail right on the head as to why they reached out to me specifically in fact the only thing that they say that seems to like relate to me specifically is that theyre a danish company and also that they make their sitpacks right here in the happy kingdom of denmark which would seem like a random factoid to most people but i am in fact half danish so maybe they saw that and they were just like hey thats a great dane lets send this her way they also drop a little bit of actual danish in the signoff down here unfortunately my vocabulary is very limited i know how to say chicken and beer but either way the pandering is working and i want to try this thing out the only thing thats concerning to me is that it has three out of five stars on fortysix reviews some people say that if felt like a great small seat that is easy to keep with you and others say that it felt like a hard pipe on  butt cheeks that doesnt sound superappealing but i feel like were this far in lets just give it a go so im going to add this to the cart and that is item number three so for our fourth and final product we decided to go for the kasamba online psychic app so basically with kasamba you pay per minute to text psychics so its basically the same as like a telephone psychic but just texting now they say that they specifically wanted to work with me because they saw the i dressed according to my zodiac sign for a week video and they mention marketing opportunities as well as an affiliatelink program  sense now i think that that connection kind of makes sense but i will say that thats pretty much the only video weve ever done in the spiritual realm i guess you could say that said i am objectively interested to see what an online psychic has to text to me so checking out their website the first thing that i see is like how expensive some of these psychics are and they all interestingly enough have five out of five stars all on over  reviews each in fact it looks like almost everyone has five out of five stars i wonder if people are scared if they like give them a bad review if like bad things will happen to them but regardless this site seems to have a lot of stuff to pick through so im gonna try it outand presumably just spend a lot of money texting psychics okay so those are our four products so im gonna wait for all of the things i ordered to get here and once i have my haul well check back in all right so its been a few weeks well actually its been a little more than a few weeks its been about two months since i ordered everything but now we finally have our haul so lets dive right in and start with the first product that we ordered which was also the main cause of the delay the zenpop box so we were gonna film this haul a while ago but this item got stuck in customs and then lost at customs and then subsequently lost at the post office so is was never delivered to us we in fact had to go and find it but now we have it and im never letting go so we got the august  box which was called the powerup box which basically means that amongst the normal savory and sweet snacks they included a bunch of candies that are flavored like japanese sodas and energy drinks so we figured we would just go through and taste each one starting with the monster hunters food gummies it kind of looks like a mashup of like a valkyrie a powerpuff girl and jon snow the gummies themselves kind of look like orange mentos hmm these arent too bad its sort of like an interesting crossover between like red bull and like childrens triaminic medicine and besides those we had two other energydrinkflavored candies lifeguard is not a mere energy drink its a bionic drink one of which was kind of like a nerds rope without the nerds its just like a long erect laffy taffy it tastes like juicyfruit but in like a laffy taffy texture and now its gone so its the same as juicyfruit and the other one of which was like a sourpatchkidlooking gummy in the shape of a japanese character that meanspower hes like this is a  energy drink bitch now the smell was definitely powerful oh my god it smells like a rubbing alcohol surprise its just for a loco but compared to the odor the flavor was pretty tame its more just like a sort of nondescript grape gummy now though these were all energy drink themed or flavored it wasnt clear if any of them actually had any energy properties it says if you believe that it gives you a power it really gives you the effect but since i ate all three in a row i guess well never know which if any had any actual caffeine so besides those powered up candies we had a coke flavoured chewy and some fruit soda flavored gum its kind of like bubble tape but it looks like a bandaid as well as some vinegar chips with a sour faced elephant mascot hes like its so sour im dead rip some barbecue cracker sticks that were kind of like the savory version of pocky it tastes a little bit like a bread stick that youve used to mop up beef stew and some sea animal shaped chocolate cookies theyre almost like oversized like teddy grahams also what sea animal is this it does look like a clam we then finished off our feast with one of our cups of ramen doodoodoodoodoodoo all right i think it looks ready lets fork up and try it thats amazing yeah thats really good i mean its definitely ramen in a cup but its really good damn i wish i had gotten the all ramen box the hem had so that concludes our zen pop box i think definitely got some snacks that were kind of out there but overall i enjoyed all of them and even if some of them like werent my favorite flavor they were at least fun to eat and maybe had some energy in them i guess well never know but in terms of whether or not i would recommend this or even plug this i think its impossible to ignore the whole shipping situation which i understand like isnt a hundred percent the companys fault but at the same time if im like recommending things to you i would not want to wish shipping issues upon you besides that there was the issue of them not having like the one time box option available on their website which sort of doesnt make sense because if they are able to send you three boxes why are they not able to send you one its not like theyre out of stock so as a consumer i enjoyed what i received but because of some of the logistics i would not endorse it okay so our next product to try out is the wifi map app so i think the best way to try out this app is to go out into the world and see if we cant get onto some wifi its kind of like a scavenger hunt but for stealing the internets alright youve got a hundred and fifty wifi hotspots near me so to test the map out i wanted to try and get on to a more exclusive wifi that wouldnt normally be available to me so not just like a coffee shop premier care dental group has wifi i wonder if this is legal it feels like a sort of whitespace legislation wise so after walking  miles we found our target fairness premier care dental were here for your wifi and though it seemed like a promising lead at first our free dental wifi dreams quickly crumbled so im trying to find like their wifi on my suggested wifi list but i dont see it anywhere im gonna try and type it in manually says it could not find the network premier dental  enjoy do we have to go in no were not going in so with premier kara bust we moved on to more residential pastures to see if we couldnt get on to a home wifi connection its a little more nefarious i would say though once we started pursuing them it seemed like all of the home wifi listings were actually just businesses listed as homes and as we drive into like a more residential area there are no listings on the app so it seems like there arent a lot of just like good samaritans out there being like use my houses wifi so a little deflated i returned to the businesses hoping to find at least one working internet connection alright it says that the pier one imports wifi was updated six days ago but it also says its called free best by wifi and even though we actually entered the store this time this one didnt work either am i doing this wrong so finally as a last ditch attempt we tried the macys across the street which seemed promising because that one is called macys free wifi right or amongst the boxers lets try and be brief thousands of people turned off the video all right so on my suggested wifi list there is a macys free wifi lets plug in and were on this is exciting oh wow were on may see wifi and after opening and loading instagram we confirmed that we did indeed have the internets okay now that we have it so even though i was excited the app did finally provide a working connection macys free wifi wasnt exactly the exclusive access i had hoped for when downloading the app especially since there wasnt even a password so although i think that a free wifi map is definitely like a useful idea a lot of the listings dont seem to work and that might vary from place to place but at least most of our listings didnt work so all that said i dont think i would want to endorse this product but two companies out there listing yourselves could be an interesting marketing technique because im now aware of premier care dental i cant vouch for their dental services but no they dont have wifi all right so next up is these at pack from the happy kingdom of denmark chada theres a chair in there somewhere alright lets get into it so it kind of has like the size and shape of like ol bluetooth speaker and the weight  its pretty weighty i mean it seems pretty straightforward especially because we watched that video so lets just try it out let me stand up so i can sit down alright so supposedly it opens like this okay and then though its already happening so as i mentioned before it basically telescopes out and then you can lock it into place by turning the bottom bit okay that feels good now the people who left this thing a negative review on amazon said that it was like quite uncomfortable so i guess well see how it feels on the old butt cheeks my first observation was that its less of a seat that you mount and more of a butt crutch oh i think i found the balance point its kind of an interesting sensation its more like im leaning against a wall than anything else as for the seat itself its not incredibly comfortable like the seat definitely isnt padded but its not terrible and i definitely wouldnt call it a hard pipe but i think the only way to know for sure how it would feel in the wild is to go out into that wild and try it out so were gonna go somewhere with a lot of lines to wait in disneyland it looks like you have a pick axe you look a little bit like a norse women its thors hammer take me to valhalla so after my show of strength tyler took me to disneyland to sit and wait all right space mountain has a sixtyfive minute line lets do this and once in line it was time to set up camp after actually sitting on the sit pack for a few minutes it didnt really get less comfortable its just like a human tripod or bike stand but there is a balance point you have to stay at i tried to dance it was too much now to be fair i wasnt sitting continuously for  minutes since there were breaks every time the line moved so im not feeling like the hard pipe sensation im just feeling the kind of like oh the lines moving let me drag a little thing behind me sensation although i wonder if it may also have been more comfortable for me because i already have some natural cushion or insulation on my behind im basically just sitting on my own butt so maybe the sensation varies from booty to booty but for my part i thoroughly enjoyed having this thing in line with me so in terms of whether or not i would endorse this product i might i would consider it i think that the product isnt necessarily perfect yet like it seems like there are some tushes that dont enjoy the sensation of this seat on their behind but i did have a lot of fun using it i like that it sort of resembles a hammer to smash things with and i also liked having a prop with me when waiting in line and at the end of the day you can lean on it so id say its okay in my book all right so our final product is kasamba the psychic app now i feel like it varies person to person as to how much you believe in these sort of supernatural things im personally on the fence i dont completely buy into it but im also kind of prone to being superstitious and paranoid so i dont usually seek out psychics just in case they tell me something i dont want to hear now that said lets open the app so there seem to be a few different categories i can choose from love psychics psychic readings tarot readings fortunetelling personal astrology dream analysis career advisor and psychic mediums so i think of all these categories im the most interested in personal astrology so lets go with that one also i dont mess with ghosts so theres that okay so we have a few different advisors we can choose from now i was immediately drawn to one psychic in particular oh psychic safina but shes in a reading right now but i like her because her name is almost sofia so hoping to catch safina after she was done i subscribed to her channel profile thingy i smashed her subscribe button well see this is your notification yes i hear that only happened some of the time however after about  minutes of waiting she was still in a session which means that someone has spent at least a hundred and eighty dollars on that reading i wish i could say i was mad but im just happy for her so besides safina there are a few other psychics online so we ended up doing sessions with two different separate psychics just to kind of test the waters oh oh its happening okay shes chatting to me with psychic number one at first i didnt know exactly what to say i feel like im speeddating yeah ive never done this before which isnt a great approach when youre being charged by the minute but once i got my bearings i asked for a general astrological forecast of the next year or so when would be a good or bad time to do things whats coming up etc etc and after taking down my name and birth date she began making predictions she says i do see that next year will be a better year for you finances will be good and there are a lot of events coming where ill be happy fun overall i would say psychic number one was generally general but also really nice oh thats so sweet she says im an amazing person she doesnt even know me but when i pride for more information on what exactly in my astrological chart was prompting her predictions she didnt really say anything okay she says yes next year will be much better sweetie yeah im looking for some like more like star reading although she did give me some specific lucky numbers for the next year 7 3  maybe i will acquire three  franchises now our second reading with psychic number 2 was a little more focused i pretty much asked for the same general astrological forecast and she had some more specific time frames for me between march to june will be good for the career growth my dear watch out for some something coming next march to june i better start thinking about that now she also said that november and december of this year would be good but i guess that covers most of the next 9 months i also asked her for some explanations on what in the stars she was seeing exactly my dear this is the transition period in your life oh i thought she was gonna say the transition period of like saturn or something so she didnt really answer the question either she did also though provide a lucky number okay says that  is going to be a good number for me which is not seven three or eleven but theres a three and a one involved as well as make one kind of uncanny recommendation so she says so just go with the flow and try wearing back on saturdays do you mean wearing black she says wearing black wow maybe shes the fbi guy it was a little bit of a professor trelawney moment but im not sure what she meant by wearing black specifically on saturdays regardless our second psychic seemed a little more specific in her recommendations so i would say she was a bit better even though they both sort of dodged my questions about the actual astronomy of the astrology now in terms of whether or not i would endorse kasamba the answer probably has to be no just because i feel like whether or not you even believe in psychics is very subjective so i wouldnt want to be like this definitely works and when youre paying by the minute the bill can rack up pretty fast however if you do like talking to psychics and youre into this kind of thing i could see how you would like this because its kind of like tinder but for psychics and also both of our psychics were very very nice so it was kind of soothing to chat with them i feel like thats probably the sweet spot for a psychic say nice things and types whoa all right so that was my not sponsored haul in terms of these products specifically im pretty glad that i got to try them out because as i mentioned a lot of these companies that blast our email do seem pretty interesting or peculiar and they mostly ended up being kind of fun that said im not just gonna start partnering with a lot of these companies because they are pretty unvetted and if im gonna be promoting something i just want to be selective about which brands i like let through to you guys if anything came out of this experience maybe ill just start buying more of these products on my own to try out now once again i dont want to malign sponsorships in general as i know theres been some controversy around them recently i personally dont like making sponsored reviews or fullon dedicated videos and thats why our sponsored plugs have been contained to like econd segments at the beginning of our but i also dont think theres anything outright wrong about doing a sponsored review as long as that person discloses it to their audience theres been rumors of like loopholes and nondisclosed sponsored reviews which i dont know a lot about but if someone is doing that i would ask them to stop because i think it undermines youtubers in general and also violate some level of trust between creators and audiences now with that said if i suddenly become the oprah of sit packs in the next month you all know why just kidding but do you want to sit back thank you guys so much for watching if you liked that video make sure to try mash that like button and if you want to see more videos like this make sure to shamash that subscribe button and a big shout out to raven danger navy for watching here are my social media handles thanks for watching raven danger navy and i will see you guys a next time hello friends and welcome to another video today im gonna be getting a  makeover so weve made a few decade fashion videos before through the  but in those videos we did most of our investigation of the outfits beforehand and just presented them in like a lookbookstyle video 🎵im sweating im sweating inside my pants inside my pants🎵 so this time i wanted to build one look with you guys piece by piece kind of like how we did with our perfect makeover video where well team up with a couple of experts and tackle the planning and the execution of the outfit the hair and the makeup to make a single  look now of course the  were a very different time fashionwise definitely but also socially and though there were many regressiveand even oppressivesocietal norms that were limiting to a lot of people there was also a very interesting watershedness of the  being sandwiched between the chaos of world war ii and the civil rights movement sexual revolution general youth rebellion of the  but for our purposes today were gonna be focusing on the fashion and mostly of the american variety and though style is downstream of society and the two cant really be separated were gonna be talking about the fashion all right cool catslets beat feet and get started and first up is the outfit so these are our like  magazines and catalogs sorry theyre so crinklyand were gonna use these for some outfit inspiration so ive got a vogue magazine a vogue pattern book and a spiegel catalog all from  now we chose  as our starting point because if people define the postwar years as  to   is right smack dab in the middle so going through this catalog you see a ton of these sort of like cinched and flared dresses and with those dresses you see a bunch of belts and pumps and gloves so this fitandflare silhouette is a descendant of what was known as the new look created in  by french designer christian dior which by  had been copied about a million times over and was available in every size and for every occasion yeah see this is the vibe and overall it was characterized by a slimmer shoulder narrow waist and full skirt now this style was diametrically opposed to womens fashion of the  which was boxier more menswearinspired and padded in the shouldersas women joined the workforce on the home front to fill in for many of the men who were away fighting in the war but with its end in  men returned home newsreel announcer and what does he want most of all he wants a job and women for the most part returned to the household it seems that with the fighting over society was eager to return to some kind of traditional stability and diors new ultrafeminine look capitalized on some elements of nostalgia for a time before the world wars as the silhouette drew from the waspwaisted fashions of the victorian era some  years earlier turns out greatgrandma had it going on see you could add some sleeves and then add a little length to the bottom and you got the  now all of that said there were a few other fashions floating around there was a more bodycon pencilskirted look as well as a few pairs of pants here and there both for the mainstream gal and for the subculture gal but i think for our purposes if were going for mainstream outandabout  the new look it had to be so to get our outfit we headed out to hit a few vintage and vintageinspired stores to see what we could find after some digging we found a few options ah tyler thats the look safiya its like those memes of mariah carey skinny legend besides just dresses you could also achieve the newlook silhouette with two pieces so i wanted to grab a few options to try that out as well so in addition to the outer clothing the newlook vibe also required some serious undergarments announcer how to get the new look even if mother nature forgot to give her the right figure for it corsets had gone out of fashion during world war i when the steel used in them was needed for military purposes and they never really got back into the mainstream rotation instead they were replaced with the onlyslightlylessuncomfortable girdle so for a similar nippingin effect we grabbed this waist cincher i feel like something like this would definitely do some serious sucking in you know now the other important undergarment was the brassiere hello dolly in the  boobs were inor i guess more accurately they were out whether they were real or had some assistance the padding might have been on the shoulders in the  but by the  it had migrated south this is hypothesized to have been kind of a freudian fashion statement because besides their sensual allure boobs are also associated with motherhood which was a big focus for women in the  given the whole returntotraditionalism thing now that kind of makes sense to me but it does not explain one of the most bizarre and popular boob trends of the decade the bullet bra i guess you cant fault it for its perkiness but besides that i dont really know why people liked this so much one theory is that the bullet bra was sort of a futuristic take on the bra drawing from another big craze of the  the space race either that or its just like a giant nipple but regardless with our undies in hand all we needed to finish off the shapewear was a petticoat to floof out the skirts and then it was time to review our haul and choose our  outfit so the first option is this dress i decided to try on each look with the undergarments on to make sure all of the structure would work with what we picked i feel so covered and yet so naked this is almost like an  look in itself and once we had all that on we could try on our first option tyler im home im feeling the waist cincher its all happening tyler its tight i was definitely a fan of the bottom half of this dress i think that like the floofiness of the skirt with the petticoat is definitely that good like zhoop  you know like  though the top half was having some issues with the allimportant bra i dont think you can see the shape of the bullet bra in fact i can feel it being smushed so i think i may have to stuff already oh oh yes thats bringing the perk right back that said and done though you can still see the strap of the bullet bra through the sheer panel around the shoulder so wed have to like find like another slip to go underneath or in between our second option is like a skirt and a shirt which i had comped off this photo of elizabeth taylor where she has like this kind of outfit on and shes like at acting class but overall i feel like it reads sort of youthful i do kind of feel like im going to school but also like my boobs are out the bullet bra was a bit much for the buttondown to contain so there was kind of like a shirtgapping situation besides that i do like the look of the separates and i think im feeling this color palette in general but overall i do kind of feel like im in high school its sort of like if only i had a poodle on the skirt like i could be going to the diner with my high school beau so we moved on to our final option so we got this dress at a vintage store and this one is actually vintage from the  so a few things i like about it right off the bat there seems to be enough room for the bullet bra and also even though the straps do like to migrate the dress does cover the bullet bra completely and i think it definitely showcases the hourglass well so you see like the bink binkbinkbink the best just ignore my mic pack in the back thats not part of the newlook silhouette so with the shape harmony with the undergarment straps and the  authenticity i think we should go with this one acessorieswise there were a few  musthaves like a pair of gloves for going out some high heelsof which we found a pair that kind of matched the top of my dress and a little handbag it feels like i should be clutching it like this it seems like hats were also popular but i was leaning towards a more summery look so i found a couple kerchiefs that could be tied around the neck and then used to protect the hair while driving if needed i feel fancy and yet also kind of elderly or also like i have an old school toothache you know like theyve wrapped a bandage all the way around my head we also definitely needed some kind of belt because our dress had these empty loops so it seems like at some point there was a matching belt but clearly we dont have that any more so with the outfit settled on it was time to move on to the hair all right so i am here with kayley melissa who is a friend hairstylist and youtuber who has helped us with some decadethrowback hairstyles in the past and shes here to save us with this midcentury do so what are we gonna be doing today kayley whats the plan kayley so in the  whole thing was that you had to do your hair for your face shape like even in cosmetology school i still learned about that as of this decade but it was extra formulaic back then s and i think this idea of having a set of rules for how you did your hair sort of plays into the whole orderly and primandproper image that people wanted to project in the  kayley so i would say that youve got kind of a hearty face shape youve got a great jawline and chin s and if any of you guys remember from our perfect makeover video heartshaped faces are also wider at the forehead and cheek so to balance out my face kayley were gonna add a little bit of volume up here and then were not gonna put a lot of volume through the center but we are going to accentuate that great jaw line with some curls that just kind of dance and play right around here s but i think regardless of what exact shape you were doing with your hair  dos in general were fluffy curly bouncy and usually on the shorter side kayley so were gonna begin with some kind of setting products back in the  they didnt have mousse didnt really have gel but they did have whats called setting lotion which is like a holding product that you would put in your hair to help it hold its set extra long s and basically it seems like most women would use it and then put their hair up in rollers for standup curls oh wow look at those little guys up there andor make pin curls without rollers thats a nice way to think of it and usually women would have their one hairstyle that they just stuck with oftentimes getting their hair permed into their preferred do to increase the longevity of their curls kayley it would be really hard to surprise perm somebody cause they smell so bad s but if you wanted to change up your hair you might have followed a curlsetting chart from a magazine or newspaper like the one kayley was following for my head are we set kayley we are set s yay kayley theyre ready to dry i feel like my son came home late to curfew im like i need like a rolling pin so we have this thing that kayleys brought us kayley it is a big old bonnet dryer s now in the  women would either sleep in their curls to let them dry overnight or chill under the dryer in the beauty parlor for a more speedy approach wah oh yeah hello friends  and welcome to my pod though handheld hair dryers were invented back in the  hooded sash bonnet dryers were a salon staple as they were more powerful less effortful on your arms and also gave an even heat around your head oh its warm just to get all of those little pin curls  am i done kayley oh yeah its all dry  s yes so all that was left to do was to let down my hair and as we removed the pins and rollers the look kind of swung between the  do i look like dave coulier and the  listen ben franklins i mean he got the most action and then it was time to brush through and tease kayley believe it or not for the  this is teasing a bit s once we had all the curls and waves looking good we decided to pin the bottom of my hair up kayley oh thats good thats it thats it yeah s i wont move just to make sure that my hair didnt look too  which was characterized by generally longer hair allegedly as a response to fabric being rationed for the war whereas in the  the dresses were big but the hair was short oh wow oh i think it looks really good awesome it looks great so we sprayed me down just to try and ensure nothing would escape midday kayley i just realized i need to groom the sideburns s just yeah spray em spray them down you dont have to zoom in you dont need to zoom in and sideburns subdued our hairdo was looking neato im learning a lot of  slang online so with our hair done now its time for me to do my makeup  style so to help us finesse our midcentury makeup technique i visited the besame cosmetics store in burbank california to talk to gabriela hernandez who is the owner of the company as well as a makeup historian now besame creates makeup that is based on actual products from the past and gabriela has also written a makeup history book that weve referenced before when making our decade fashion videos all right so i guess the question is where should we begin so right off the bat gabriela started describing the bold and defined nature of the  everyday makeup look starting with the eyebrows gabriela the main parts of the face in the  were definitely the brows were very defined in the  the shape of the brows also became more angled than you had in the  which were softer so it was definitely more aggressive the  were definitely feminine and aggressive aggressive femininity i would say  s all right just aggressive glam gabriela exactly s so following that advice we started off with the brows i dont know if you guys can tell but i got them waxed a little bit just to clean them up and give them a nice like arch so im just gonna use a little pencil just to like fill it in over here and just not overdraw too much but just like darkened kind of like an elizabethtaylorlike  does she do that okay so after the dark arched brows lets move on to the eyeshadow so gabriela mentioned that eyeshadow in the  was kind of pastely and colorcoordinated gabriela a lot of the times they were into the style of matching their outfits to their shadow and so i am going to try and match my eyeshadow to the dress tyler will you hold this so after looking at a few different palettes we found a few options that could work thats something and as for where on the eyelid it should go im gonna go kind of for like this vibe where its mostly on the lid and then it kind of like goes into the crease a little bit as well oh yeah i feel like that looks pretty much like what were going for so im gonna take on the complexion next and when we asked gabriella what we should be using for our foundation she immediately replied pancake gabriela in the  this is when pancake makeup became a really a thing the look was very much of a porcelain kind of doll type s so pancake foundation was like a dry cake that you applied wet and then it would dry down on your skin creating an overall matte finish gabriela so powder foundations are kind of a similar look to what pancake was s oh yes so powder foundation we got all right so that is the base very matte powdery and onetoned so up next well take on the cheeks now  cheeks were a bit differently adorned than modernday ones gabriela now like that whole contouring and bronzers are in where at that time they didnt really do that they wanted the face to be more round and feminine and not necessarily chiseled s and all we needed to get that round look was some rouge oooh all right just a little bit okay hold on just a second before you say that turns out you need a pretty light hand with creme rouge so i turned to more modern tools to help blend it out i dont think ive gotten a hang of the creme rouge just yet but eventually we got to some acceptable level of redness and then to finish off the complexion i have some like pinky setting powder just to sort of cement the like rosy look i think so with our complexion done it was time for the last few products starting with the allimportant eyeliner gabriela the liner was really more defined than they had been in the  and in the  s in particular the  were noted for the popularization of the cateye wing here goes nothing im using a liquid eyeliner which did exist back then but people also used pencils to do their liner as well theres one sort of now the question is can i get the other one to be even all right eyeliner i dont think its perfect but i think its like okay its good enough to vlog it now to finish off the eyes we needed some mascara so i used this vintagestyle cake mascara which i have to wet to like turn this into a little mascara paste and then apply it to my eyelashes like so in the  both cake mascara and cream mascara were popular apparently like a wandintube mascara had already been invented but wasnt super popular until the  and  so with everything else done were onto the crowning glory of the look the lipstick and particularly with lipstick specific colors were marketed to suit certain complexions better not saying that some lipsticks werent more universal but overall it seems that warmtoned lipsticks were marketed to blondes redheads and lighter brunettes and coolertoned reds or pinker lipsticks were marketed to darkhaired ladies loosely and generally so i have like a cooltoned red lipstick and i also have more of like a purpley orchidcolored lipstick though i think both would definitely look good i think the red is a little more iconic  so im gonna go with that in terms of the shape gabriela mentioned that lips were often overdrawn gabriela you can see that a lot in like if you look at lucille balls pictures really overdraw that top lip so that it looks rounder like two big mounds s with the intent of making the lips more luscious and sensual but im just gonna get a little bit of a liner just to like overline the top just a little bit okay so i think with a little bit of lip liner this is the finalized  makeup look that im going for so im gonna go and throw on my outfit and then well hit the town all right so this is our finished  look so to complete our makeover we thought we needed one additional accessory a  chevy bel air  i got to put the windows up to save the hairstyle tyler yeah all right i dont know how any of this works oh i see it oh i see it all right im in drive tyler oooh which we drove just far enough to stop and then pose next to you remind him of his grandmother so for our final final outfit we had our authentic  fitandflare dress our array of midcentury accessories including these white cateye sunglasses topped off with our aggressively feminine makeup look and our stillmostlyalive coif oh i keep taking my gloves off to like do things tyleryeah s dont wanna get them dirty and then i forget that im not wearing them which is completely not allowed besides the small accessories like the gloves the undergarments in general were definitely the most different to experience theres enough things around my midsection that i definitely feel like  the stuffed bullet bra also helps with that because im kind of like  the bra definitely played a strong supporting role throughout the day tyler look safiya theres a plane its like your bra s  is it going to space though im still a bit confounded by it obviously i dont have any cleavage but thats the dresss fault but like i just i dont feel like its like a ah a mothers bosom its like a like   like a laser beam but speaking of mothers bosom as soon as i had the whole outfit on together i went straight into a motherly state of mind i think because of the gloves i almost feel like im checking areas of my house for dust and apparently that meant i was ready to apply disciplinary action to things around me the branch just stuck my hairdo thats very rude tyleryoure gonna put him in time out s youre on time out it was just all the little trappings of the  look that made me feel very different i definitely feel more hourglassed than i usually do i almost feel like im advertising waist trainers on instagram tyler but i also feel like i could just go home and whip up some gelatin and then stick some ham inside tyler please dont s so as we mentioned we wanted to hit the town in our outfit get in loser were going shopping grocery shopping which for better or for worse involved more driving of the earold car hey what do you think youre doing bye i tried to leave tyler behind but then i realized i needed someone to continue filming tyler yeah i think so god help me s all right lets go mamas driving mwahhahahahahaha hahahaha ha i think after a little bit i was starting to get the hang of the old bel air honey how was your day at school tyler can you look at the road but regardless for our evening out our first stop was a bite to eat so were at this mcdonalds in downey california which is the oldest operating mcdonalds in the united states apparently was opened in  so take a gander at a blast from the past my bra just blasted it out there now despite its appearance it does offer the normal  mcdonalds menu where do we go oh here but although the food and the seats may be modern it does have a lot of fun retro mickey ds paraphernalia that matched my throwback vibe so after finishing our food and doing a little dancing tyler thats called the mcdonald shuffle we hopped over to anaheim to check out another  establishment disneyland how do i look tyler you look like your hair shouldnt be going anywhere and once in the park we beelined for one of the original attractions there when the park opened in  the carousel tyler are you smacking the horses butt though i was a bit disappointed i missed out on a different original attraction the bra store which used to be located on main street and was home to the wizard of bras which i think is just this guy however it did close in  so i missed it by a couple of decades so with no bra store to go to it felt like it was time to wrap up our day or at least thats what my feet were telling me i think my feet might be done with the  my feet dont like the decades or any shoe thats not a birkenstock all right so that was my  makeover so even though this outfit is definitely very different from modern styles i would say that some elements of  style have come back in over the last  years but a lot of things have become defunct just because of new technology like once control top pantyhose were invented girdles pretty much got the boot but overall the most different thing to me about  style was actually how many rules there were and consequently how easy it was sort of to construct an everyday  look like back then you needed your gloves and your stockings and your girdle to be acceptably groomed and put together sure there were alternative silhouettes but  fashion was very easily definable at least partially because the information pipeline was so narrow there were a handful of key designers a few fashion magazines a sprinkling of movie studios and like 5 tv channels versus today where its so easy to see so many different styles that even though we still have makeup and fashion trends its hard to come up with just one look that defines  style thats not to say that kim kardashian doesnt try though i mean maybe if she can make bullet butts a thing ill take it back but until then id say today is still more openended thank you guys so much for watching and a big thank you to kayley melissa and gabriela hernandez for helping us out with our transformation if you liked that video make sure to shmash that like button and if you want to see more videos like this make sure to shmash that subscribe button a big shoutout to wildrose for watching thanks for watching wildrose and i will see you guys anext time ♪this is safiyas new intro song ♪🎶 woop hello friends and welcome to another video today im gonna be buying and opening an amazon return box so im guessing that most of you guys have probably bought something from amazon before and at least some of you have also returned something to amazon now ive done both of those things and to be honest i always assumed that when you return something they just zhuzh it up and then sell it again but supposedly unless its a hundred percent  unopened like new new amazon actually sends their customer returns to a liquidation facility where they are bundled with other returned items and auctioned off to the highest bidder so we found this website aptly named liquidationcom which amongst other things auctions off these amazon return packages and it seems like from the looks of it you can get a lot of returned merchandise for a fraction of what it would altogether sell for at retail price like thousands of dollars worth of items for like a hundred bucks which sounds good maybe too good so i figured it would be fun to bid on and buy a return box and when it gets here see if its actually a really great deal or if these items are a little further away from almostnew than we had hoped all right lets start bidding so im gonna open up liquidationcom and liquidationcom doesnt only service like amazon returns but you can search specifically for them and when you look at just the amazon returns you see a lot of different packages that are up for auction in the next day or so like housewares air conditioners apparel health and beauty xboxes you name it they may have it so lets take a look at this apparel bundle just so you guys can kind of see how these listings are laid out so for this one specifically you get sixtyone items with a suggested retail price of  and right now the top bid is  usually there are a couple of photos that oftentimes arent like very helpful theyre sort of taken at closeup angles so you dont get a good view of the whole package but you can see everything thats supposed to be in the package because they have this manifest where they list every item thats in there the only trickery that might be afoot is maybe if the items are in bad condition i wouldnt be able to tell because the photo is just of a timex watch really close up you can also see on the manifest that even though each bundle is categorized like this one is supposed to be apparel there are still some random throwins in each package like four items called bed bath home and closet as well as a thermos and an american kennel club antianxiety calming coat for dogs which i guess is apparel but its just dog apparel so there is like some elements of an ebay mystery box its not a mystery but its a box of a lot of different things all right so now that weve kind of like walked through a listing lets just like take a look at some of the ones that are available in the next day or so im mostly interested in apparel and health and beauty packages because i want to get something that we can try on or put on our face my face my singular face so on this first page there are a few apparel listings it looks like this is like an ugly christmas sweater right here with some pentagrams on it its a little early for christmas but i guess for like satanic christmas its just  its just a yearround affair theres also something called aquadance in here it says the ultimate shower experience so this listing has a hundred and ten items in it and its retail value is said to be  with a current bid of  in general i think a lot of these listings are marketed towards people who are opening up stores who might want to like buy a lot of things to have inventory to sell so i feel like maybe with this listing theyre hoping for like a  satanic showershop owner im really intrigued by this category assorted bed bath home and closet because it seems like a lot of these listings just have like a bunch of those thrown in im pretty interested in this box so im gonna call it option one but were gonna keep scrolling and see if we cant find some other options as well this sounds kind of interesting this is a health and beauty package and one of the marquee items is a braun epilator i think epilator is like a hairremoval device tyler usually waxes my mustache so this package has fifty items in it and the retail value is supposed to be  and the current bid  but in one of these photos it looks like something is very broken or torn up thats a very revealing photo im surprised they included that so it actually looks like there are two different kind of epilators which are electric hair removers besides that we also have a couple of water flossers a whitenoise sound machine i wonder if thats the thing thats broken here as well as a lot of like hairstyling tools and a few mystery health and beauty items so thats the general gist of this package so well keep this one in the running and ill keep looking around for a couple more options ooh interesting so this is a housewares bundle but it says there is a teacup set in it and that piques my interest right away so there are fiftyseven items in this bundle and the suggested retail value is  and the current bid is  its pretty good its a pretty good one so in this manifest it looks like the most expensive item is a roayl  quality fur felt hat after that it seems like theres actually just a lot of apparel items before we get to any home goods but there is a removable plate grill and panini press now thats intriguing oh and at the bottom weve got a bunch of mugs this one actually does sound kind of promising even though im not really big into like fur things so im gonna put this to the side as option number three and lets just see if we can find one more possible option and then well decide between our four so this listing has a pingpong table i dont know if we have space for it but it does sound exciting in this same listing theyre also selling a cage and a crib so i dont really know whats going on there or its a little bit strange ooh this one says rayban sunglasses that looks interesting all right so this is another apparel bundle and it says that it has fiftyfive items in it and its suggested retail value is  and its current bid is  so it looks like the most expensive item is a donna morgan peyton gown but it is a size two so i would not fit into that but then the second most expensive item is our pair of rayban sunglasses which are worth  besides that it looks like most of the other apparel is like athletic apparel oh wow and then we also further down have a naughty by nature faux leather garter slip and thong set this one seems to have a little less logic as to how they pieced everything together but you know i feel like all four of these packages have just some strange items thrown in all right so i think we have our four options of course we have our first lot which is the sort of like occult christmas sweater lot and then our second option is our hair bundle as in there are a lot of hair removers and also hair stylers our third option has the teacup set panini press and fur hat and our fourth option has a very expensive pair of rayban sunglasses and then a lot of extra fun stuff thrown in as well now i feel like usually when people buy these packages theyre looking for like the best resale value but im more looking for products we can test so i am actually leaning towards the hair removers and stylers bundle just because ive never tried an epilator before and also because there are a lot of electronics in there and im interested to see if maybe they were returned because theyre defective or something so theres six hours left in this auction so im gonna start bidding on this guy and hopefully win it and once its finally here well test some of these things out okay so im up about six hours later and i just swooped in and got the winning bid on our listing turns out that while i was sleeping a lot of people bid on our braun epilator so the price got jacked up like all the way to  which is still a good deal but like not as good of a deal as it looked like before so we also have to pay for shipping which i knew beforehand wasnt going to be cheap but its not cheap shipping is actually about two hundred dollars so the entire price of the package comes out closer to five hundred dollars and i think thats probably because we got like a package thats so far away ours was in indiana so if it was closer itd probably be cheaper and if it was even closer you could just go pick it up in person but regardless its on its way now so next time you see me ill have my haul all right so its been about ten days and our packages have arrived so as you can see we have four packages three boxes which are like pretty intact looking and then this box i remember seeing something kind of smashed up in the photos on the listing but i dont remember this specifically so im gonna drag all of our boxes into the garage oh man this ones heavy oh this ones heavy so we can unbox everything and make sure we got all of our items and see what condition theyre in oof all right  so heres how were gonna do this so were supposed to have fifty items in here though i dont remember every single item specifically and there were also some mystery items on the manifest so well see what that means but in general im just gonna take everything out and categorize them into different piles all right heres box number one ooh looks like theres a hairbrush tyler oh yeah we could like um sanitize it ah so this looks like the broken product from the thumbnail photo which i believe is the aroma diffuser it actually doesnt look super broken should i just put them on the ground this is an oil diffuser and this is a hairbrush now lets see what other things we have like those so this looks like a giant like toiletry caddy doesnt it ohmygod its a guitar case i dont think i have a pile for that yet next up weve got a couple of electric razors one of which was on the manifest as an assorted home and bath product as well as another hairbrush couldnt see any hair on that one ah this is like a box of syringes looking at the manifest it turns out that this product was actually listed as a stove gap cover which is what it says on the jar so whoever returned this just kept the stove gap cover and replaced it with these random syringes so now we have them ah heres one of the marquee items the water pick looks a little beat up but i guess well see next up we have a waterproof leg protector it looks like it goes over a cast in case you want to swim shall i put the leg protector with the guitar case because theyre like cases all right and then we only have a couple of things left in here like some unopened dove soap headband earplugs electric toothbrush heads and this compression leg massager is this real all right so that is box number one empty so there were fourteen items in the first box and at least one hair ready for box two ooh so right at the top there are some flushable wipes and then weve got nitrile finger cots oh tyler theyre like tiny condoms for your fingers it says for medical examination use tyler oh tyler oh if you need to examine something with only your finger i dont know what were gonna do with these tyler yknow we dont have to use them all right im just gonna put these with the syringes and were just gonna leave them there moving forward we have some beauty vitamins a diva shower cap another water pick and somehair styling tools now this is the true marquee item the braun wet and dry epilator i did grow my mustache out just for this occasion we went to australia i let my moustache hairs grow as wild as the australian bush and weve returned weve also got a scale um where should this go maybe like medical instruments this is just kind of like things we dont want and then we have our whitenoise machine some clinique cleanser more toothbrush heads some foundation and a ton of mens deodorant do you like that kind tyler well you like it now we also have this which is actually just another electric hair remover but it looks kind of suspicious now there is a lot of stuff in this  box which kind of appeases some of my anxiety of wondering if we even got all of the fifty things we ordered and some of that stuff has been kind of surprising like body lubricant its for nsfw purposes yeah it says squeeze proper amount of the product on the fingers and spread it censored the bottle neck can be directly censored into the censored which is more concise more health  and more convenient im gonna put this with the medical supplies all right so to finish off box number two we have a memory foam wedge cushion for some  wedge  and ive also got a knee brace so after box number two we have thirtynine items so there must only be eleven items in the last two boxes maybe the destroyed box is just like one giant carton of lube all right box number three okay so weve got this heel guide compression stocking aid its like if you cant bend down to like put on your socks you can use this and weve also got another scale lets put that with the lube aside from those i have this deess beauty kinda like deez nuts but deez beauty which is our other expensive hairremoval device we also have this shower bench as well as this haphazardly repackaged hair curler and this box of lens cleaning cloths that like totally exploded down there in fact im just gonna leave them in the box for the time being but with that weve got fortyfive items and only one box left all right here we go oh my god oh my gooh my god ohmygod wait this is why its so heavy its a single ound weight ahaha sort of shockingly the rest of the stuff in here looks pretty intact oh this is heavy too it says everyone lotion two pack coconut oh this could be this could be what were waiting for oh yeah this is some like sold at whole foods lotion tyler oh is it s mmm that is nice im pleased with that so with our fancyschmancy lotion it looks like we do have fifty items maybe not all the items we or the manifest expected but theres fifty i think personally im the most excited about like the face and bath products but im also excited about the number of electronic devices that we have which definitely like ups the value of our entire haul but i guess the big remaining question about the electronics specifically is do they work so lets try and just see if they turn on im basically just gonna be plugging everything into this outlet that also is plugged into our adt system just ignore it but also dont break into our house so i started by plugging in all of the heated hairstylers i dont know how this works it looks like a medieval torture device but its on and its warming it looks like you could maybe cook a hot dog in there all right this is the same item again see you got a pair of them you can cook two hot dogs they did all turn on and become hot though i dont really know how to use any of them besides the normal hair dryer and the straightening brush which seems straightforward enough but i still dont know if i did it right then i plugged in a few assorted items starting with our aroma vapor diffuser ooh whichamazinglydoes work despite its smushed packaging mmm smells like  our whitenoise machine also worked tyler ohh though it wasnt quite what i thought it would be oh its just one noise its just a little fan in there thats making a little white noise in regards to our two water picks which are pretty high value items one came out of the box looking pretty good oh yeah this looks nice and new almost too good oh ohmygod ohmygod ohmygod but once we got it under control it seemed to work pretty well oh oh the other one however was missing quite a few pieces i dont think that has any water pick heads yeah what the heck this one doesnt even have the the water thing this one is incomplete after that we ran into a few more duds including our compression leg massager which i still dont quite understand did i do it wrong these are new batteries right and apparently i never will im very sad to say i dont think this works our scales went 2 for 3  they all turned on but the one in the middle is reading like almost a full a hundred pounds more so i guess its either two for three or one for three depending on which ones right we also had this pair of sleeping headphones which were more of a design dud the speakers are like right here so theyre way behind my ears so i could barely hear anything which usually isnt ideal for headphones i think so should it be in front of my eyes after that we took on our mountain of electric razors which all turned on but most of which had other peoples shavings still on them except for this one which thankfully came freshly sealed afterwards we finally arrived at our marquee hair removers the titular braun epilator and the deess beauty hair remover we decided to epilate first both ooh s oh my god i just saw my life flash before my eyes which works by grasping multiple hairs at once and pulling them out at the root so the effects last longer than shaving all right the time is nigh to release the beast so we put on the facial cap to the epilator which didnt really make it look any less terrifying and took a stab at it ah ow yeah turns out its way more painful than waxing oh oh that hurts oh and for some reason tyler also wanted to try it out tyler ooh ow tyler god tyler ow im sorry are you okay and he confirmed it is painful in terms of results i didnt really see much but i know thats probably because i havent built up the pain tolerance to actually use it im sad this hurts me all right so we do have our other mustache removal alternative which is deess nutz so after looking at the box it turns out its actually a straightup laser thats like a mini version of one you might use at a laser hair removal clinic oh yeah they gave me sunglasses all right this is what ive found so the instructions actually say to not go straight to using it on your face and to do a patch test on your arm in case the laser discolors your skin im okay with my arm being discolored but like the mustache is the moneymaker so we got to keep that area fresh so without further ado we got to zapping oh tyler oh oh yes now for actual laser use you usually have to shave first and then laser but for the patch test i didnt do that oh do you smell my singed hairs tyler oh my god i do and after a few more cursory zaps i think we deemed this product a success in that it does zap this is straight up a laser hair remover dude this is awesome so those were all of the electronics which mostly worked or at least turned on and i think just with the electronics alone we had already earned our initial money back now for the remaining items you can pretty much just eyeball their condition and besides a few hairs they all look pretty usable there were a couple of boxed products that we opened out of curiosity though like the memory foam cushion oh is it for your butt oh yeah oh my god im gonna sit on this right now take a good look at it cause youll never see this again oh yes this works we also opened the stocking applicator which required some assembly i dont want to read instructions but after some sock finagling it ended up working just fine oh tyler wooo oh my god its magic tyler i love it all right so that was our amazon return box haul overall im pretty impressed with all of it and i feel like we did get some good bang for our buck i think my main complaint with the whole thing is that its a pretty involved process and you do get a lot of random stuff so im not sure how practical it is for like an individual person to buy and i think if youre someone whos trying to buy and then resell these items even though most of this stuff works almost all of it came used so you wouldnt be able to resell it for like  retail value i think the ideal consumer for this box specifically might be someone whos trying to open up like a hair salon or something and i think more generally these boxes might make sense for someone whos trying to acquire equipment for a business or maybe stock a dorm room or hallway or entire freshman dorm as for me there are definitely some things that im excited about and i want to keep but i think were probably gonna donate the extra hair tools to a beauty school or something and maybe donate the lube and the finger cots to a doctor i guess maybe one that likes to party or not i dont know thank you guys so much for watching if you liked that video make sure to shmash that like button and if you want to see more videos like this make sure to shmash that subscribe button a big shoutout to itzel for watching thanks for watching itzel and i will see you guys anext time intro music hello friends and welcome to another video today im gonna be examining fake makeup items and their real counterparts under a microscope now recently ive been seeing a lot of videos where people will look at their skin or their makeup under a microscope to see whats really going on down there so i ever a fan of makeup science decided that i wanted to get in on the action and take a closer look at some bad makeup so a big shoutout to tina yong who i believe started this trend and ill link her original video down below as well as few other microscope videos so throughout my time buying questionable things online ive stumbled upon a few fake makeup products which are basically like knockoff designer handbags but just makeup where some manufacturer out there will replicate the packaging of a well known or desired makeup product and fill that packaging with a presumably lower quality product to sell at a lower cost now fake makeup has become kind of a prevalent issue in the last couple of years not just because they rip off other companies but also because they kind of operate outside the law theres no oversight as to what ingredients are used in them so when fake makeup has been seized and tested people have found a bunch of gross stuff in there like bacteria lead and animal feces yum so i thought it would be interesting to take a closer look at some of this fake makeup and the products they seek to replicate on my skin but first a big shoutout to honey for sponsoring this video if you guys dont know honey is a free browser plugin that automatically checks for the best promo codes every time you shop for something online which i do a lot so basically if you download it right before you check out itll check out its database to see if there are any promo codes available to save you some money it works on a lot of popular makeup websites like ulta morphe and sephora and ive personally saved some money on those sites as well as some more random stores like anese which is where i get my butt scrub thats a real thing so if youre interested in trying it you can download it at funny coincidence that honey rhymes with money i wonder if that was intentional but anyway for now onwards to the science so for our experimentation today we have like five different categories of makeup now we got all of our fake items at this alley downtown thats notorious for selling like the knockoff products except for the foundation which we got from our wish makeup video and that coupled with the price that we got them for makes me like  sure that these are fakes but of course there is some possibility that theyre real but im pretty sure thats my disclaimer so were gonna start with the eyeshadow so lets just dive right into there and uh start looking at the stuff so for our eyeshadow i chose the too faced sweet peach palette and i have to give props to the fake product here because the packaging on the outside looks like really really similar i actually wrote on the back of this one fake just in case i forgot alright so these are the insides of the palette and i will say that the packaging once again like looks like very impressively similar and the fake one even smells like peaches i would say the fake one even smells slightly more of peaches but when you look at the actual eyeshadows the fake ones do look a little less saturated but well see how they look on the face so lets start with the real palette that seems like a good place to start its kind of like our control of the experiment tyler off camera yeah this is science so i think the look were gonna go with is sort of like a simple look that has a matte shadow a glitter shadow and a shimmer shadow just so we can get a good mix of stuff going on underneath the microscope tyler off camera oh its like a pu pu platter hopefully there is no literal poo poo in the fake one now were gonna go in with the same colors on the fake palette and see what that looks like on this eye also another disclaimer i am going to be putting fake makeup on my face but i do not endorse using fake makeup do as i say and not as i do alright so first off im gonna go in with peaches n cream that one doesnt look so bad and then the second color summer yum it doesnt really look the same as the real version and it also looks like there may be some debris in there i mean i see something its not like super present but i guess its not zero so the next color were gonna go in for is candied peach which i did swatch already and i did also find little white dots in oh that is such a different color on the eye thats not even trying to be the same and then the last color were gonna be using is this shimmery shade nectar oh thats not so bad in some ways i almost feel like this shimmer shadow is a little bit more glimmeryer like im seeing more glimmer to it tyler off camera yeah so obviously my eyes dont look exactly the same theres definitely a lot more stuff going on on the real eye sort of fittingly i kind of look like i have pink eye it may have been like a freudian slip of the brush besides that i think that we got something going on so lets bust out the technology alright so here is our microscope which is a handheld digital microscope that we got from amazon and you basically just stick it on your face and zoom on in alright the moment of truth oh my god tyler off camera there we go oh wow look at those wrinkles oh my god do i have hairs on my eyelids damn it alright so what im seeing here is basically a decent amount of little shimmery sparkles and them some sort of peachy color and a lot of wrinkles alright so why dont we take a look at like the inner corner of my eye this is where the glitter should be tyler off camera oh im seeing some glitter oh oh that looks like a dinosaur im definitely seeing that color come through like the sort of like creamy champagne color i love having a microscope now im gonna go in for like the outside part of my eye which is like where the peach and like darker brown colors should be i will say that we can definitely see the pink color for sure i think im just getting some serious like sunburned old dude vibes its like coming home from the nude beach at the end of the day alright so with our control established lets go in for the fake so right off the bat i can more clearly see my little like eyelid hairs we definitely can see like no color at all basically and we can see sort of almost like a thicker glitter chunk alright so thats kind of like the mid socket shot so lets take a look on the inner corner just to see the shimmer again ooh okay that looks kind of nice and also kind of like the shimmer shade on the other side and finally lets look at the outer corner which is where like the matte shadows are okay theres like nothing over here under the microscope my other eye like actually looked pink and on this eye you can see almost like a little bit of peach stuff in the crevices but you cannot see any pigment just on the eyelid i would definitely say that this is more of a crack situation alright so i feel i think thats a pretty good look at like whats going on on my eye so before we wrap up the eyeshadows i was thinking we just really quick swatch a few of them on my arm just to like see what they look like on a flat surface and well do just like one matte and one shimmer just so we can see like the real difference alright so those are my swatches ooh i mean that looks very nice its kind of like a very full coverage eye shadow like you cant see my skin tone pretty much at all i love when i just kinda squeeze my skin it looks like a weird animal breathing as for the fake swatch it looks sort of like it did on my eye where like its settling into the creases of the skin and in the creases its orange but then in between the creases its almost just like a little bit of cheeto dust or something okay so im gonna take a look at the shimmer shades now oooh my god wow i look like a lizard person unlike the matte shade you can see that the color doesnt get into the cracks as much like it more sort of like glides above them and then with the fake shade i can already say that it looks better than like the fake matte color but it is definitely one not as dark as the original color and two you can definitely see like more of my own skin through it alright so with that i feel like weve thoroughly investigated the eye shadow palettes i think that in general its very clear that with the fake palette the mattes are almost like nonexistent and there do seem to be some weird like filler specs in the matte shadow specifically the shimmer shadows do replicate the original shadows better but its still not exactly the same so thats the eyeshadow lets move on now to the foundation and for my foundation i have a fake and real fenty foundation so obviously the packaging on these two look very different the fenty is kind of like a tall drink of water made of glass and this guy is like sort of like a little cylinder much shorter and made of plastic alright so this is the real fenty foundation and it kind of comes out like a little watery and in like a large squirt so im just gonna basically use this beauty blender and buff it over like this side of my face the real side of my face the thing that i noticed right off the bat with the fenty foundation is that its pretty thick and it also dries down quickly like you kinda gotta work fast alright so heres the fake see the thing that stands out to me about this fake foundation right off the bat is how sort of like selfforming it is like its not very liquidy it kind of like stays in the little turd shape and then when i put it on my face it kind of has like a gellike consistency and you can also see like in the finishes that the fenty side is much more like dried down and this side is just a little wet  im gonna do a few more squirts of that cause it is actually a pretty good color match to the fenty but it is definitely not as full coverage alright  i think thats something i will give it like a second to dry like fan me for a moment youre not helping at all laugh what is this  flopping fish and then well jump in with the microscope alright so that is my skin with the foundation on it you can definitely see like some of my skin through it and you can also see a couple of strategic cheek hairs it definitely does gather around the cracks but i would say that there is foundation kind of like in between the cracks on the smooth part of the skin okay now lets zoom in a little closer oooh thats so gross wow look how oily my skin looks in between the foundation specs t thats fighting back s oh t thats a hair follicle s it focus right in the hair follicle alright lets go to the wish side i guess not surprisingly this side look a lot shinier i do think you can see more of my own skin tone through this and i will say you can not see the cracks on this side of my cheek as much probably because this is a much wetter foundation lets zoom in shall we oh god oh its so oily down here it looks more like deepfried hair alright thats pretty gross i think that you can definitely tell its a lot oilier especially at this like closer focus point and though i think that like from the further away focus point i  looks like a little bit better it is because it is just not as full  coverage versus on this side its like thats the fenty foundation combatting your skin alright so i think thats pretty much our foundation investigation i mean i think that theyre very different foundations i dont even know what they were thinking like with the packaging with the consistency like i think its a pretty obvious fake alright so with foundation finished next up is highlighter and for highlighter i have the anastasia beverly hills moon child palette right off the bat i can kind of tell that this is the fake one its definitely got this thinner cardboard and it does not feel as heavy and then inside they dont look like the same colors pretty  much at all but they are called the same thing and the font is like pretty similar hello friends and welcome to another video today im going to be attempting to wear the t long extendo jeans so in our questionable fashion series weve taken on a few pairs of strange pants before including the clear knee mom jeans and the completely clear jeans and weve also encountered some oversized denim before with the oot long sleeved slender man jacket and i do think that over the past year or so people have been doing a lot of weird stuff with denim so a few weeks ago an image started circulating around twitter of these extendo pants made by this company bronze  now they seem to be like a skateboard apparel company whose normal price point is pretty midranged but for some reason they decided to make seemingly unsellable t longlegged  dollar jeans and per usual the internet was mad but thankfully we were lucky enough to snag a pair if lucky is the right word i have not yet really taken these out of the package because i wanted to save it for now but the amount that is spiralled is like very concerning its really just a dense log of denim this is like the yule log except jeans alright ready ty should we get another camera i feel like we need another camera because its about to go like off the table oh my word where do they end where do they begin im honestly like actually speechless gobsmacked dumbfounded just absolutely aghast this isuh an anchor for sure you could anchor a small boat with these i think  unless a like large octopus or squid came by and tried to mate with it which is also possible i mean the thing thats sort of concerning to me is that like i dont think we can get like a good shot of all of it in frame right now unless i just like bunch it up like this and im like here are my pants this pile so why dont we put these things on and see how they look on a body so to actually put them on i wanted to go to a different room with some more space to spread out my anaconda dont want none unless your legs are 9 feet long hun i was a little nervous that i might not fit in to them waistwise because these pants only came in one size oh itll be fine itll be fine oh actually it fits with a little room to spare safiya nice but once i was in i had to face the daddy long legs my feet are just like dragging like a long veil almost like a denim bride you obviously couldnt walk outside with these on cause then you would just trail them around or really anything  elevator alligator it seems from the looks of it the jeans get their lengthiness from being three pant legs sewn together and my feet fall like right the first pair of pants end like heres one pair of pants and then theres just more but though it was unwieldy overall there is definitely something fun about being able to like whip your pant leg around like so you could probably do some like fun like rhythmic gymnastics almost you know what i mean like put ribbons in your hands and be like whips legs hwahhh its okay i hit the wall its fine and besides longdistance slapping you can also sort of lasso objects and then fling them across the room i just hit myself oh that was pretty good after a little experimentation it felt like it was time to venture outside but to do so we obviously had to face the issue of the jeans just dragging on the ground though  had posted a few photos to show how one might do this like in this instagram where they scrunch up the jeans accordion style so that your feet stick out the bottom this look may be more functional but it retains none of the grandeur of the 9 foot long legs and the posting of this photo kind of reminds me of how with the 4 foot leg sleeve denim jacket the company selling it changed their marketing photo to one with the sleeves folded over which completely concealed just how long the sleeves were after they received some criticism about the ridiculousness of the item in terms of the actual logistics of the scrunching even though like the waist is actually kind of loose at this point  my thighs are just so juicy that i cant scrunch em up  as these pants stood they kind of looked like a lumpy pair of flare jeans from like the waist to the knee its kind of like a  like dad jean and then from the knee to the floor its like michelin man but even though that might not have been the desired look it was really all we could do so i grabbed a pair of chunky shoes and we headed out and about now my initial concern was that the pants would unwind and fall below the shoes and i would get caught in stuff but my sneakers actually did a pretty good job of plugging the denim up and after a few minutes it became clear that the actual obstacle of wearing these pants was just how bulky they were 
safiya oh yeah it was also very warm outside  which didnt really help the ankle insulation situation its gonna be kind of like one of those things you know where like celebrities wanna lose weight they just wrap themselves in saran wrap  and sweat out their juices thats going to be my ankles  so though the pants werent dragging on the ground they were kind of difficult to wear and although we had the rough estimation that the pants are 9 feet long i wanted to know exactly how much the pants weigh and also how much surface area of denim the pants have  so after busting out the scale and weighing em these pants weigh in at about 3 and a half times what my normal pair of jeans weigh  and also have about 3 times the square inchage of denim which kind of makes sense but at this point most of that was concentrated around my calves  safiya oh my god savage
 now as i mentioned before  is a skateboarding apparel company look guys i found my board so even though running and walking in these pants wasnt the easiest i wanted to see if perhaps they were ideal for boarding like maybe adding weight to the bottom of my legs would lower my center of balance nah nah nah naaaaah ahhhhhhh  now it doesnt help this experiment that im terrible at skateboarding but i dont think i was any better because of the pants oh my god too fast too fast too fast lean to where ta daa my other thought was that maybe the bunching of the fabric would provide more cushion to your legs if you were to fall acting oh no i have fallen off of my skate board actually my knee is not that padded my shins are padded
 tyler this is like the worst crash dummy test ever so after having the pants rolled up for a while i wanted to see what else we could do with them rolled down and my first instinct was to get me a pair of stilts so we got these like painters stilts which are kind of like the stilts that i used once before in like a theatre performance but unfortunately the pant legs were just too were too skinny for the foot bed of the stilts to fit through it looks like it can get through to about the mid thigh and then it stops which was kind of disappointing because i had hoped to become slender man especially with my addition of my addition of the long sleeved denim jacket so i decided to table to stilts for now to see if there were any other skinnier stilts we could get to try and attempt this transformation again later in the video so with my slender man dreams at least momentarily shelved the question of why these pants exist seemed more pertinent than ever because if you cant wear a 9 foot pair of pants with a standard pair of stilts why make them at all now my initial thought when i first saw these pants was that they are kind of like inverse jnco jeans just long instead of wide and the extendo pants scrunched up even sorta resemble the slouchyness of jnco jeans a little bit which back in their day sort of took the baggy  skater pants look to the extreme a second possibility for why the pants might be so long is as we mentioned in our why project denim jacket video exaggerated silhouettes in fashion have historically connoted wealth and high social status as seen with giant finger nails in china through the h century as well as large unwieldy pannier dresses in h century france so i guess following that logic these jeans would be made to show just how much denim you can get but i think another obvious possibility is press as i said before over the last year and a half or so a lot of clothing companies have come out with weird or ugly items and though its not clear if at first it was intentional at this point a lot of people know that if they make a crazy clothing item they will get a lot of press or in some cases a video about it kind of like these ones and i think if i had to guess  is kind of playing off of that escpecially since the product description on their website is just what youll buy it one additional thing to note is that at the time of filming this pretty much everything on their website is sold out i cant totally confirm this but i kind feel like they are combining the ugly item strategy with part of the supreme strategy aka making only a few items that will sell out quickly to increase hype the pinnacle of which was seen with the supreme brick which is literally just a brick with the word supreme on it that they sold in  but regardless if any of these possibilities are actually why these pants were created we still wanted to find some real life use for them so we set out to find somewhere where we could let the jeans unfurl in all their glory tyler oh yeah now the first place i thought i might be able to dangle off of was the side of the pier from the rules that are outlined it does not seem like what we want to do is against them are there any authority figures around tyler theres a lifeguard over there is he vigilant but after deciding it was worth the risk i let my jean flag fly tyler youre like a bizarre art experiment tyler laughs but though the jeans got some good air while hanging off the side of the pier i wanted to try a second location which was a slightly lower ledge to unlock what we believed might be some untapped potential in the pant tyler they look pretty damn good right now first off we wanted to send something up to me via the legs we refer to it as a pulleysystem but i think its actually more of like an elephants trunk safiya what will you send me
tyler im gonna send you your phone
safiya good i need that we had also brought our own bucket for lifting purposes i made tyler attempt a few items so i could perfect my rapunzel technique so with our first utility extracted from the pants we wanted to see if we could use the jeans in a real flynn rider situation safiya dont break the pants safiya grab both grab both can you rappel upwards tyler  alright denim be strong safiya alright maybe we shouldnt maybe were done so maybe these things cant support an entire human but they can carry a small basket and besides their usefulness the pants unscrunched are much more majestic tyler i think when unfurled i like em when all bunched up theyre just living a lie i completely agree when theyre unfurled like so its like how can you not somewhat enjoy this so i wanted to see if there was a way to walk in the pants without dragging them on the ground while also displaying their full length so we looked to an old friend for some help  the teva uggs so we took our opentoed tuggs and spooled the legs through them so we had a sole protecting the pants and an opening wide enough for the jeans to flow through almost like a denim carabiner safiya im crosscountry deniming the thing is like who knew that the teva uggs could be so useful tyler yeah so i sort of ended up with like thick marionette strings attached to my feet or kind of like horse reigns for myself safiya im steering myself
tyler laughs to the left to the right though at rest the extra fabric almost gave me like a tail or a pet to sit next to though once i stopped moving i really got a whiff of myself safiya i smell so bad
tyler you dont smell great tyler i was about to say its sweat and seawater so it felt about the right time to retire for the day although we didnt want to fully close with chapter without trying the stilts one more time we were actually able to find circus peg stilts that we had to further saw down to try to get through the pant leg but once again we were thwarted by the skinniness of the jeans because even if the stilts could fit through my foot flexed could not so i couldnt stand on the stilts but i could sit uncomfortably in this chair so i took my long sleeved denim jacket and the pants back to our ledge to achieve my slightly deflated slender saf dreams though it was fun to have four floppy denim appendages so it wasnt a total loss so overall i would say that these extendo jeans are definitely kind of fun especially if you have the space to spread out and whip your tentacles around but in terms of actually being able to wear them its a bit more difficult it is possible to wear them scrunched up and we did come up with a secondary method of spooling them through sandals but i think its pretty weak that you cant wear them with stilts not that a lot of people necessarily have or wear stilts a lot but if youre selling giant pants that you cant even wear in like the one situation that i can think of where you would need giant pants its a little bit of a proverbial middle finger to the consumer especially at that price point and of my long denim items i do think i prefer the y project jacket just because its easier to wear and though the extendo pants do make quite the visual impact when fully unfurled i think im going to have a hard time finding opportunities to bust them out but maybe we could use them in our house as like a pulley system to transfer small items in between floors maybe not the best use for  dollar jeans but definitely a use for  dollar jeans thank you guys so much for watching if you liked that video make sure to shmash that like button and if you want to see more videos like this make sure to shmash that subscribe button a big shout out to triveni for watching thanks for watching triveni and i will see you guys anext time hello friends and welcome to another video this week im going to be getting my makeup collection professionally organized yes i need help and im getting help so as you guys may know im a bit of a lipstick hoarder and though i feel like i have a pretty reasonable amount of other types of makeup at least for someone who makes a lot of beautyrelated videos the total amount of cosmetic items that i currently have is definitely in the fiendish range and as my collection has grown exponentially since i started making videos its unfortunately never really been organized in any kind of useful or productive way but then recently i started seeing a trend of some other youtubers decluttering their makeup collections and also a few videos of youtubers getting help from professionals to organize their living spaces so i thought why not kill two birds with one stone and finally do something about my makeup storage situation while also filming the whole process for some good organization porn dont worry there wont be any nudity but you may see a whole lot of nude lipsticks so a big shoutout to tatis series on cleaning out her beauty room and gabbie hannas hoarding room video for being the inspiration behind this project and im going to link their videos down below as well as a few other decluttering videos ive watched so as for finding a professional organizer to help us i feel like there a few different routes that you can go there are some that help with like serious decluttering if you need to throw away a lot of things which is sort of like that does this thing bring you joy if not chuck it philosophy of organizing there are also some that help you organize not just material things like bills and taxes and mail but for my purposes i wanted to find a professional organizer that focuses more on the room design and decor elements like getting the right drawers and cabinets to help build an organizational system so we found this company called practically perfect who seem like pretty seasoned professional organizers and from what i can tell from their instagram are also really into drawer inserts cabinets closets and some good old storage porn so we hired them to come over and help me achieve my organization dreams if any  viewers are doing a drinking game to this video take the word organization off your list i dont know why youd be doing that but just in case so i am here with joni and kitt from practically perfect who have agreed to help me organize this space laughter so before we dive right in to the organizing let me bring you guys up to speed on my current digs so right now all of my makeup is in this one room that we recently emptied out it used to be our editing room as well so i guess because of the lack of space it was kind of like a makeupcomputer room and i would just sort of dig around for my makeup and then do it at my editing desk so now that weve moved our computers out this room is sort of like a meh and so i thought it would be cool to besides just like organize the makeup which i definitely some help like maybe turn this more of like a makeup room like a beauty room so up until this point i had been using two main structures to hold my makeup one of which was this shelving unit in the closet all of these plastic bins have lipsticks liquid lipsticks or lip glosses and then theres some foundations over there in a box by themselves down here im not sure what that is it looks like highlighters that looks like makeup weve used in a video perhaps those look like cotton pads to me um theres a pool noodle i dont know why thats there i feel like this whole structure is actually not horribly organized for storage purposes like most things are bucketed by category but because its just in bins i never really get to see all of my options so thats this thing let me show you that thing kitt  joni yes please the other structure that we have is this white set of drawers in the corner which has most of the rest of my makeup organized roughly by category and area of face kitt this is ikea and i like how this is storing but  s i like that you guys just know laughing this is ikea and im like i think so and though it requires a little less digging than the bins its still not winning any efficiency awards and requires some degree of excavation and i think thats the biggest problem with the current system that im not able to use all of my makeup to its full potential i feel like right now im using the makeup that is closest and i think if i were exposed to more of my makeup consistently i would use more of it i dont want to like eliminate a lot of my makeup though i think that probably some of it could go but i think that i would love to be able to like find more of it better kitt  joni yeah and just have it all be like a little cuter besides that my wishlist for the room is a surface somewhere to actually do my makeup right now its just happening where i just like take an armful of makeup and like take it into the current edit room to do my makeup kitt okay and also a spot where i can set up a camera and film me doing my makeup like vlog style since i currently do that while standing at my white set of drawers so based on my wishlist and the problems that joni and kitt observed we decided to pull all of the makeup out of the closet joni our philosophy is always that things should be visible and accessible neither of those things are the case for you right now so what we would very much like is for you to be able to find the lipstick that you need in a quick easy way s with a plan to build a vanity out of drawers where i could sit do my makeup and mayhap film a little bit were gonna need a lot of drawers huh joni youre going to need just the right amount of drawers for your makeup kitt but i think what would be good for you cause i know that you have product coming in all the time is were going to use a lot of drawers but but hopefully were going to leave some open space in each of those areas so that as more product is coming in youll have space to put it where it needs to go so for this project we set aside two days with the team from practically perfect and to prepare we went to ikea to grab some drawers and a desk top ikea tyler scandiland i like to call it what a wonderful place at first the plan was to match the original white tower but that product was unavailable so we decided to go with the sortofsimilar alex drawer style joni and kitt also grabbed some drawer inserts from the container store which i think is where the drawer porn comes into play not to be confused with porn drawer thats a different thing all right so we are here for day one of makeup collection organizing so we have some ikea stuff to build and some makeup to i think just like sort of  kitt sort and edit and organize yeah i was about to say decant i dont know why i was just like throw on the ground and look at also we have ashton here from joni and kitts team and since you guys are the professionals where should we begin kitt well we always start off with pulling everything out sorting organizing were going to help you organize by type by color and kitt was not kidding because they dove right in and started dumping boxes out onto the carpet oh my word all right its happening im like that michael scott gif its happening its happening all right so weve emptied most of the lipsticks out this is like probably like  of them how are we going to do this what are we doing right now kitt well i think what were going to start doing cause its the easiest to start is by sorting by brand cause the bottles look the same they have the same shape s in addition to organizing them by brand we also organized them by type ie lipstick liquid lipstick and lip gloss s what are you working on kitt i donti had a pile of kylie somewhere i dont know what happened to that s kylie is just hiding pp she is hiding s shes pregnant again shes in hiding looking at all the lipsticks laid out it was interesting to see which brands i was more of a completionist for do you like how i have every colourpop shade that is a greygienude tyler this is a little troubling tyler i feel like thats the same color s its not theyre different and also which brands had been a completionist on my behalf the interesting thing is i bought a lot of black moon cosmetics on my own and then like some time late last year or early this year they sent me like a massive pr package and i was just like ah ha ha ha ha black moon lipsticks not withstanding nowadays when we get pr packages ill keep a few items that i like and then give the rest to our team or donate them but even then i will say that it slowly piles up and contributes to the scaling of the collection all right i just realized i didnt bring this box out the other major contributing factor to the clutter has been makeup that we bought specifically for videos this box for example not only had some pokémon makeup and some kylie valentines day makeup but also a few bags of loose carmine anatto and iron oxide that we used in our history of lipsticks video those are just pigments dont worry about those i will take those away so i tried to centralize all of the boxes of makeup props from videos that i knew were littered around the house i have some wish makeup some japanese drugstore makeup and some miscellaneous im so proud of myself i brought more work though it was kind of fun whipping out some products from our older videos all right so these are my bite lip lab custom lipsticks this is dothraki screamer tyler oh that is dense and then this one is mrs norris still smelling as delicious as ever so after some work we had finally gotten all the lip products sorted out by brand and though my original thought had been to sort them into drawers by color keeping them organized by brand made the most sense because of the uniformity of the tubes but i still wanted to address the concern of easily identifying the color of each lipstick especially for the brands that dont already mark it on the outside so i wonder if there is a way that we can maybe even like put stickers or something on the bottom to like indicate what kind of color it is because i think that my biggest barrier in using them is number one not being able to like see and find them but also number two like when i look at like all of the bite lip tubes and im like i dont know what color these are then im just like never mind so kitt assured me that we would be able to do something to account for that obstacle and with that we were ready to move on to the putting away step so we are going to bring some of the ikea furniture in to start like putting the lipsticks away into also this is caylie also part of joni and kitts team caylie hi introing her so no ones confused when another pair of hands appear now we had gotten these specific lipstickholding inserts from the container store so that we could arrange the lipsticks standing up like so sliding into your dms like so our main goal for this step was getting the lipsticks off of the ground and into the slots primarily so we could see how many inserts we would need overall and how many drawers the lipsticks would take up with the plan that the following day would be more focused on playing drawer tetris to see which products we would want where and though it was satisfying to see all the lipsticks standing erect like little soldiers it was also a little alarming to see how many drawers were actually being filled up with lipstick im fine emotionally financially unclear after the traditional lipsticks we moved on to laying down liquid lipsticks into flat drawer dividers which went a bit faster though i would say we had two mega collections to topple one of which was colourpop it was always going to come to this wasnt it but i have already caught many of them and paid dearly for it and the other one of which was nyx which came in all different shapes and sizes you get a nyx and you get a nyx what is thatthe otherthe oprah gif shes like and with those hurdles lept we wrapped up the parade of the liquid lipsticks and filled up all the drawers in the first tower one tower acheck so we turned our attention now to the second of the two towers i guess narratively this must be saurons tower of which we filled the top three drawers with the remaining lip products so thats the lips s finally so our next step was to do the same process with the other categories aka dump and lump ashton okay so weve got some more tubs out here and what we wanna do next is go through them and kind of see what categories we have as ashton began doing that i started to take on some of the clutter that was bulking up the bins like old packaging or empty and expiring products should i get like a trash can in here i feel like it is time now my life philosophy is that lipstick never expires whether or not the fda agrees but i will concede that some items of makeup like concealer foundations skin care and some eye products like mascara may have to be chucked after a certain point thats probably from  should we get rid of it ashton bye dont tell me how old i am at the same time we continued to empty out and categorize different types of makeup and tools from my original drawer set boom bruschettas including complexion products eyeliners and mascaras bronzers and blushes and eyeshadows and palettes which caylie started arranging in these leaning palette organizers i tried to smooth like the carving over but um itll never truly be the same but they didnt die tyler no theyre not dead they just got harmed slightly though we did unfortunately discover a few actual casualties that i hadnt thrown away yet tyler weve encountered a tragedy this nyx blush has blushed its last cheek fare thee well softspoken blush okay give it a moment of silence please where is it shall i compare thee to a summers day thou art more lovely and more temperate after that i was gently banished from the blushes and was tasked with decluttering the box of foundations and im going to start throwing away old foundations this is empty so there we go goodbye and then please please throw it away oh gonna keep my custom foundation though though my general rule for tossing was that i was gonna get rid of any foundation over two years old or that were empty i found myself having a tough time parting with products that could be useful in a video down the road this is probably from like  yeah because at this point ive kept it for so long what if i need to make a i dress like it was  video even with that clinginess though i did manage to slim down my foundation box a lot i cant be sure but i feel like im doing pretty good on these foundations look how empty this thing is ashton look at that  oh wow ashton i can be sure thats great s i just chucked a bunch of them now while i had been busy digging through my foundations ashton had been sorting out the bronzers and caylie had been cruisin through the palettes caylie theres more palettes though over here s oh there are caylie yes caylie absolutely caylie wow caylie well good thing guys we have an extra caylie just for highlighers at that point the only two categories left to declutter were mascara i think some people say youre supposed to throw your mascara out every three months this is from february of last year and concealer i would say that this product is probably maybe from college listen i used to be more tan i used to spend more time outside and with that we had gone through pretty much every category of my makeup so were nearing the end of our like dayone accomplishment i dont know whatever we did today which left us with all of the remaining products placed into drawer inserts so then tomorrow we can basically just start putting them in the drawers and then decide like which drawer is best for like which product kind of i feel like a lot happened in the last like hour i feel like it was like three hours of lips and then like an hour like an hour of like turbo organizing so with that day one was wrapped all right so its day two of organizing and weve got the whole team here and weve got a lot of stuff to do they have a laminating machine in the other room that theyve been fiddling with and i dont know whats happening kitt well all the sorting has been done so the game plan now is to assemble the vanity kitt weve got the mirror weve got the drawers weve got the table top s so we brought those remaining furniture items into the room placed the desk top on top of the shorter drawers and as a finishing touch added a vanity mirror with lights tada hello as we had touched on before our next step was to play drawer tetris kitt so this is all lipsticks yes kitt this is going to be your like everyday general makeup and then i think i dont know what comes next s so we wanted to arrange the drawers based on like what order the products are used and also how much of each thing i had in the meantime joni and caylie had devised a solution to the lipstick tubes that didnt have color labels basically by swatching them on a piece of paper laminating that paper putting doublesided tape on the back and then holepunching the swatch out to create a sticker to put onto the lipstick tube oh my god wow joni thats pretty exciting right s thats so cool joni so now its very clear whats what s thats like exactly what we needed so as the drawers started filling up it was time to label them all right so ashton right now has the labelmaker and were going to look at fonts ashton yup so im going to print out one and see if you like it s okay awesome because its not true drawer porn without a label label on boom i like that fun bold font after finishing our labelling we added a chair to the vanity yeah yeah and coincidentally joni and caylie had also finished their laminating wow from the buckets joni from the buckets from the buckets wow wait guys are we done kitt yeah joni i think were done we are im shook i feel like this morning was a real whirlwind kitt yeah yeah s there were so many of us and i was just like  though the time may have flown by i was really happy with how everything was looking well you guys did such an amazing job  thank you so much thank you two i need a high ten please all of the makeups acheck so i think with practically perfects organization leg of the project done the room was like  finished with just a few tasks left for tyler and i to complete first up we ran some of the unopened makeup products that i had over to a donation center that accepts cosmetics and then afterwards we headed back to ikea in search of some furniture items to make the room feel a little less empty tyler are we back here s all roads lead to ikea tyler literally we found an ottoman and a couch that we liked so majestic did you get our ottoman tyler no and we found the rest of the items we were looking for online aka another ottoman and a rug since the original fluffy grey rug actually impeded the use of the lowest drawers and after moving those things in our new makeup room was finally ready all right so welcome to my finished beauty room tyler oh yeah this is my beauty room dance tyler okay s its kinda like a grape vine tyler how long have you been wearing that dress s ive been wearing this dress for four days so let me give you guys a tour of my new vanity this tower as you guys probably know is like entirely lipstick from top to bottom we have four drawers of just traditional lipsticks one drawer of like mixed liquid lipsticks and tradtional lipsticks followed by four drawers of liquid lipsticks then in these shorter drawers on the righthand side of the vanity we have our everyday essentials on top underneath we have mascara and brows eyeliner and lashes single eyeshadows or like really small palettes and then underneath that we have all of the brushes the bruschettas but i also have my favorite brushes right up here then in the shorter drawers on the lefthand side ive got concealers and setting powders blushes and bronzers highlighters primers and foundations a lot fewer foundations than before and then setting spray and other face sprays finally in this far left tower we have the rest of the lip sprawl weve got lip pencils lip glosses and like balms and scrubs followed by three drawers of emptiness aka room to grow then i have two drawers of palettes that would like fit inside of the drawers and one drawer on the bottom of cotton rounds and makeup wipes outside of the drawers we have all of the palettes that wouldnt fit and we also have some fun bonus decor we added these three floating shelves to the wall over here weve got these vintage lipstick tubes over there weve got the pigments from the history of lipsticks video no longer in ziploc bags now in clear jars and over here weve got our frankenmakeup our two custom lipsticks from the bite lip lab which you guys saw earlier and also two items that we got from wish that are actually not really for display but im keeping them separate from the collection because we are going to make a fake makeup video in a couple of weeks but they dont really look out of place so maybe theyll live there forever besides that we also have a few select pop figurines on our nice vanity mirror as well as this tabletop tripod so i can vlog my makeup application like this tyler or i could do that s or tyler could also  do that so thats the vanity which takes up this side of the room but on the other side of the room we have this little sitting area that weve created so tyler or anyone could kinda like take a nap hang out yes sure thats true so that is pretty much our finished room so im really happy with the way the whole room turned out especially when you think of how far it came in just a few days and i would say that having professional organizers assist us helped a lot especially since taking on my entire makeup collection was kind of a daunting task but having both their expertise and also like literally more hands definitely sped things along and made it much easier and i feel like our finalized beauty room and makeup organization hits both their checklist of our items being visible and accessible and having room to grow and my overall wishlist of having a surface a place to film and general cuteness i think after this experience i may have been bit by the decluttering bug thankfully i dont actually have any desire to buy more lipsticks right now especially after seeing them all lined up but i do have a desire to buy a labelmaker and a laminator i dont know what ill be organizing next but mark my words it will be laminated thank you guys so much for watching and a big thank you to practically perfect for helping us with our beauty room if you liked that video make sure to shsmash that like button and if you wanna see more videos like this make sure to shsmash that subscribe button a big shoutout to plupple for watching thanks for watching plupple and i will see you guys anext time hello friends and welcome to another video this week im gonna be dressing like seven different youtubers now as you guys may know ive done a few seven day outfit challenges in the past like dressing in different outfits that represent my zodiac sign for a week dressing like different store mannequins for a week and even dressing like my boyfriend tyler for a week and i thought it would be fun to try another one of these style challenges but this time with the styles of other youtubers just to see what it would be like to retire my bat wings for a time and try on some other youtuber fits so i decided to do some investigative research a nice way of saying intense internet stalking to see if i could come up with seven outfits that capture the trademark looks of these youtubers without one just wearing their merch or two asking them for advice none of them know im doing this and i hope theyre not mad now a couple of other prefaces this isnt just a list of my favorite youtubers or the only youtubers i like though i will say i do watch and enjoy all of the following peoples videos so no shade to them or to anyone for that matter as a general rule i chose youtubers that i think present a distinct personal style that i could replicate so with that lets get to dressing like other youtubers for a week so for our first youtuber outfit we went with simply nailogical aka cristine rotenburg holo tyler  so cristines channel started off focused on nail art tutorials and though she still does do those occasionally shes also branched out to a wider range of topics including banana hacks and spreading the message of holosexuality aka becoming aroused by holographic stuff cristine its holo biiitch for this outfit i repped christines home and native land canada pretty hard tyler act canadian oh im sooorry tyler thats your canadian impersonation thats my best canadian impersonation tyler very apologetic apologetic with an accent with a sweatsuit and shirt from the canadian brand roots which is a favorite of hers as you can see on her instagram and in many of her videos im just a sentimental sock please roots give me a brand deal overall it seems that cristine favors comfy wear with long sleeves long pants and when she retreats fully into the hood of her sweatshirt she calls herself a sock cristine im just a sock tyler you look like foreskin this is a different iteration of sockfiya its cristine sockenburg as for the shoes we needed some item of holographic clothing and i find that besides her nails cristines feet are where she most often expresses her holosexual zeal cristine has like black adidas superstars that have holo stripes we couldnt find those but these are more holo so as i show off my nonpainted nails in terms of accessories aside from her love of holo and socks cristine also loves tea and not just the metaphorical kind so i feel like while im dressed as cristine oh yeah and her boyfriend ben brings it to her at seemingly any hour of the day cristine beyyn beyyn is that my tea beyyn is that you tyler tyler what wheres my tea 
why did i sound like cookie monster when i tried to do that tyler does cristine sound like cookie monster i think theres also a hint of yoda in my cristine asking for tea voice tyler tyler tyler alright imma spare the audience from hearing that anymore lets go get the tea tyler so tea in hand and larynx thoroughly gargled the only thing we were missing to complete our transformation into cristine was a cat as lovingly harassed as her cat menchie is crusty gang crusty gang crusty gang crusty gang did i do it right listen up menchie i dont know if youre ready for this but crusty is coming for your whiskers so for my next outfit i dressed up like casey niestat so casey niestat is a daily vlogger from new york city whos often seen bouncing around the streets of manhattan either on one of his morning runs or cruising on an electric skateboard hey someone took my board hes also known for his signature camera work scenic time lapses and montages how much do you think i need to film for it to be enough for a time lapse so for his outfit i chose a black suit with a skinny tie and vans sneakers i would say that casey appears very frequently in suits and tuxes he used to wear them more for special events earlier on but now a days hes wearing suits a lot so im in a suit
tyler yeah safiya and theres a plane by overhead how expensive is your most expensive seat and of course it wouldnt be a casey niestat outfit without his custom sunglasses which hes almost always wearing rain or shine the reason that casey says that he wears these sunglasses all the time is because he doesnt like looking into the lens or the viewfinder and getting crosseyed which i completely understand because that happens to me all the time so i actually like the sunglasses approach we made our pair by replicating the instructions in our tutorials basically you take some sunglasses put painters tape over the back lenses spray them down in primer and then scrape it off in a haphazard manner with a popsicle stick i havent taken the painters tape off yet so i cant see anything tyler they look good though safiya they smell even better tyler they smell toxic safiya ooo yeah safiya caseys hair is also a pretty signature part of his style so theres absolutely no way i can actually replicate caseys hair because he has naturally curly hair or at least i assume that he does and my hair is much longer and straight but he did have a manbun phase so im gonna go for like a crunchy bun this is aqua net hairspray which i still have from our  video i dont think he actually uses aqua net hairspray but i thought it would give my hair that kind of crunchy looking effect did you just spray one spot though i would say that the hair and sunglasses are pretty consistent elements of caseys style casey doesnt always wear a suit obviously he has a more casual office look and also an active running look safiya 7 minute mile is pretty good for me tyler 
youve never ran a 7 minute mile safiya in high school i ran a  tyler get the fck out of here safiya and occasionally he wears a youtube varsity jacket and snowpants and gets dragged around in the middle of a blizzard to the tune of frank sinatras new york new york start spreading the news im leaving today i want to be a part of it new york now i did this for quite a while longer than im proud of tyler are we getting hit by a car  tyler im presuming youre going to heavily reference this video right no im gonna give no visual aids whatsoever if you dont know the reference get out though for casey i think it was more of a onetime thing but i just couldnt help myself i like frank sinatra so for my next outfit i dressed like laurdiy aka lauren riihimaki i cant tell you for sure that thats how you pronounce her name but you know were both part of the hard to pronounce club so i feel like i get a little pass as her name implies laur does a lot of diy crafts and hacks on her channel and besides tutorials she also posts diy battles an occasional music videos such as the rap song diy queen and weekly vlogs which often times feature her boyfriend alex wasabi together they have been dubbed laurex tyler hey saf
safiya yes tyler  what would our like uhhh safiyatyler name conjunction be safiya safty tyler what about safler safty safiya like a little flaccid safiya filer tyler filer  so all the names are creepy lauren does experiment with her style a fair amount but i would say that highwaisted jean shorts crop tops and midrifftied flannels are some key elements that she often returns to tyler yeah safiya so im just im fidgeting tyler yeah i feel like the midriff is a big focal point of this outfit safiya so for this look i went for a pair of black jean shorts a striped halter top a red flannel a black bomber jacket worn around the elbows white sneakers and a pair of aviator sunglasses tyler thats not very diy queen of you safiya im diy uh nosepicking laur does a few different things with her hair but i chose this sortof halfup baby top bun which i clearly didnt execute very well because it kept flopping around tyler its like an acorn maybe it couldve used some of that casey aquanet because i kept having to redo it tyler  kind of yeah its more scraggly but its more erect its not a safty tyler  no  so for our laurday get it
day we decided to try and recreate one of her diys which required a little trip to the crafts store   tyler  i feel like with the amount you like to eat stuff i think you would die as a diyer though im not a big crafter i do like stores i found some googly eyes im gonna go home and put googly eyes on all my plants the craft we took on was a diy galaxy phone case made by painting a plain black phone case with nail polish and buffing it in with a sponge stick that doesnt look so bad 
we gotta buff it like lauren though i wouldnt rate myself very high on the diy scale this craft didnt actually take very long and i think it came out looking pretty dern good its kinda cute is it v cute
thats a high compliment tyler overall i would say it was a pretty productive day im not sure im good enough at diys to be a diy queen but i could be like a diy rook so for our fourth youtuber outfit we went for trisha paytas im ready to mukbang
tyler i am too im hungry trishas channel is pretty much a mix of a few different formats she does mukbangs storytimes vlogs and music videos tyler how many trisha songs can you sing along to the only one i really know is thiccc girls are a boys best friend but i would say that trishas glitzy bold style is pretty iconic this look specifically is a recreation of an outfit that she wore on her instagram earlier this year as well as when she was caught by the paparazzi with ryland adams it also touches on some signature elements of trishas style pink lace shiny comfortable gucci or are they versace either way hers are real and these are fake from amazon prime in general i would say that trishas outfits swing between very casual and very glam and we chose this look in particular because its kind of both i also chose this outfit because i recognized the pants as we had bought literally the exact same pair in olive green earlier last year to maybe make a video with but we never did why couldnt i have bought them in pink then i already wouldve owned these so for our day dressed as trisha we thought it was only appropriate for us to experience our first mukbang so we decided we would take on a mcnugget mcmukbang ala trisha and shane what sauce do you want
sweet and sour
sweet and sour please alright so we got  chicken mcnuggets a large diet coke and a medium fries is this a business expense definitely                                        
 and after receiving them we took them home plopped on the floor and began to eat so i just got all this stuff and then ive got like a giant thing of ketchup too cheers to the mukbang hell yeah oh thats good overall i think im actually into mukbangs so far this is fun this is 1 of 4 boxes though i have only eaten 1 chicken mcnugget so far and though i dont think i can scarf them like i used to as a kid the nuggets were pretty darn good i feel like im having flashbacks to the last time ive had chicken mcnuggets from mickey ds just like boom i know im like
im  im smelling the plastic of the play place there was always that one kid that went into the play place like without underwear on for some reason
really or youd be like climbing up the thing and look up and be like scarred safiya that chicks commando thats traumatizing it was it was tyler repeats for no reason so dressing like trisha plus mukbang
acheck so for our next outfit i went for a superwoman aka lilly singhinspired look what up everyone its your girl safiya good thing my name starts with an s so i can do this fingerthing huh i dont think youre doing it right thats a z what up everyone its your girl zafiya ah okay safiya there you go zafiya okay now you just go between them so superwomans channel primarily features scripted comedy videos sometimes showcasing mainstream celebrities and also her rapping talent and amongst her large portfolio of videos is her series of her parents reacting to pop culture moments we found a little less evidence of lillys full outfits on her youtube channel itself where shes often in character and you actually rarely see her bottom half but we did find a lot of photos of her looks on instagram i feel like lilly has a pretty varied style though i would say her outfits usually fall into three categories red carpet lilly bawseoffice lilly and sort of a canadian casual lilly which is what im taking on today this outfit specifically includes distressed jeans which actually do make the rare leg appearance on her channel chunky timberland boots and an acidwash denim jacket worn casually around the elbows i think that one thing about lillys style and some of the elements of this outfit capture it is that shes definitely marinated in a little swaggu yeah its kinda like my jackets not really on but i dont care im also sporting a toronto vintage raptors jersey this outfit is brought to you by the toronto raptors and the raptors brought to you by drake yes as i insinuated lilly is canadian as well as sort of like a raptors super fan and she can often be seen at their games wearing an assortment of their merch this jersey in particular is a vince carter jersey and vince carter is a very prominent player for the toronto raptors
was tyler corrects was a very prominent player he was cousins with tracy mcgrady he was a cousin of tracy mcgrady well he is a cousin of tracy mcgrady he still is one more uh he went to unc  he went to unc number 3 overall pick  so hes not even canadian genuinely surprised
no does drake know as we mentioned lilly can also be seen dressing up like her parents in her videos who have pretty iconic looks of their own at this point coincidentally i also have an indian mother to dress up like who in all likelihood would also be shocked by nicki minaj what safiya lilly lilly 
lilly my dad however is danish and i would honestly be very surprised if he had any opinion of nicki minaj at all why is it so loud were watching nicki minaj
quiet whats up with your hair
quiet quiet quiet  what else can you say so next up for my penultimate outfit i took on jenna marbles aka jenna mourey my name is safiya im  years old and i have a basketball game tomorrow tomorrows thursday theres nothing wrong with thursday you can have a basketball game on a thursday
 i guess youre right so jenna has been on youtube for quite a while and over time her channel has evolved from shorter comedy videos to longer unscripted videos about her dogs her boyfriend julian life makeup and the trials and tribulations of her eyebrows oh yes and the basketball thing amongst the many memes of jenna marbles i believe at some point last year she began imitating a vine about a boy named trey my name is trey i have a basketball game tomorrow its unclear if her basketball game ever arrives but shes brought it up many times hi my names jenna im  i have a hamster and i have a basketball game tomorrow hey guys its me i have a basketball game tomorrow anyway i would say jennas style in general is pretty laid back and layered and we get a good sense of how layered she is in her podcasts as she seems to be gradually turning into a human blanket which is a good vibe overall but for the middle of july in los angeles it was a little tough its so hot
its toasty im hot  hot badumtsss
hahahaha as for this outfit it includes a black twitch tshirt which is often repped by both jenna and julian a black hoodie and blue and white flannel tied around the waist black leggings and black fuzzy slides now there are only two examples of her fuzzy slides that we could find but the one time that i met jenna at vidcon in  she was wearing similar fluffy sandals so i can only assume she wears them all the time jenna also often wears a neat dude beanie at first i actually thought this was her merch it turns out its not and almost always wears a dark black plastic tattoo choker shes also usually surrounded by her dogs now we dont have any dogs but we do have a cat yyyeahhh we do so jennas dog kermit has a thing for irish spring soap but when we presented our cat crusty with a few bars of this stuff he seemed thoroughly unimpressed immediate dismissal but like jennas dogs he didnt seem to like being put in a costume either now to finish off our day as jenna marbles i decided to do the unthinkable and play tomorrows basketball game today this should suffice for my basketball game look at how many there are
there are a lot tyler agrees unenthusiastically so i warmed up with some dunking is this regulation sure no way that looks really high or at least dunk attempts what can i say ive got hops now i never said i was good at basketball in fact i dont think ive touched one since my sophomore year of high school but i will say i made a lot more shots than i thought i would catch ya on the flip side i didnt make any over my shoulder though catch ya on the flip side tyler wheezes  alright im gonna quit while im ahead ahead im not sure jenna would be proud of me but maybe well see her at the game tomorrow and we can ask her then and finally for our last youtuber outfit we chose the king of trash shane dawson me now shane has been posting on youtube for like  years and both his video style and his personal style have changed a lot in that time currently hes been producing a lot of longform investigative videos often times in multiinstallment series with a healthy speckling of his classic conspiracy theory videos now im not exactly sure where the shane referring to himself as trash meme began  im not a girl im just a trash bag but i thought we couldnt wear his outfit and not go on the search for some garbage the top wont open ugh me oh hello thats you after a few drinks i guess in a sense shane wears trash cans though more often he kind of resides inside of them ive got it im gonna do a threepart series on luxury trash cans tanacon more wheezing but besides trash cans me i would say shanes style is pretty simple and can be defined as a shirt that is to say he tends to find one shirt that he likes and wears it for extended periods of time currently his shirt du jour or i guess du on is his oh my god pig merch shirt which i paired with black jeans and black running shoes and if you hadnt noticed were also at taco bell hey look im here now i tried to avoid just wearing peoples merch as their outfits but with shane i was left with no option ooooo thats their new merch photos put me on amazon shane just put me right there from what i can tell the only exception to this one shirt rule is his conspiracy theory shirt which is kind of like the shirt im wearing here but this is just a dupe because shanes actual tshirt was very difficult to track down so difficult in fact it was almost like it didnt exist so when looking for shanes actual conspiracy theory shirt i found two clues one was a listing on the website the hunt which linked shanes conspiracy theory shirt to a poshmark listing for an american eagle tribal printed baseball tshirt but when i went to buy it it was sold out the second clue is the first appearance of the shirt on shanes channel from what i can tell this shirt was first featured in the thumbnail for a video called reading dirty dms from fans published on january h  now to try and find the thread to connect these two clues together i tried to look for images from the american eagle  catalogue but the only image i could find was this one of their showroom in october of  now theres no sign of shanes shirt here but if you look closely at this hoodie there is a similar horizontal tribal print so it was probably an american eagle tshirt that shane bought in late  or early  and i may have overreached a little bit a lot but hey thats just a theory sorry wrong youtuber okay so those were my seven youtuber outfits i really enjoyed trying to piece together these looks especially the ones that were really far away from my own everyday style and it was fun kind of vlogging a day in the life of some of my favorite channels im sorry if i permanently ruined frank sinatra for anyone im not sure that this experiment says a lot about how youtubers dress in general because if i had chosen a few different creators i couldve easily ended up in all gucci which wouldve been not only different but also very expensive but overall i would say that most of these youtuber outfits were pretty casual and pretty layered even if they did have their own unique or glamorous flairs with the exception of casey whos outfit was pretty dressed up but that might be a new york versus la thing although i guess cristine does live in ottowa so well just leave her up there for now thank you guys so much for watching if you liked that video make sure to shamash that like button and if you want to see more videos like this make sure to shamash that subscribe button also a big shoutout to all of the youtubers i dressed like this week please dont copyright strike me ive linked all their channels down below if you want to check those out a big shoutout to malynn for watching thanks for watching malynn and i will see you guys a next time hello friends and welcome to another video this week im letting you my subscribers choose my tattoo so a few months ago when we hit 4 million subscribers on this channel i let you guys choose my hair color and during that video we threw out the idea of getting a tattoo if we got to 5 million subscribers well if i hit 5 million subs maybe ill let them pick my tattoo next and lo and behold that day has come now ive always been open to the idea of getting a tattoo but i just hadnt found something that meant enough to me to actually get it and though i may have said it jokingly a few months ago ive actually thought about getting a channelrelated tattoo for a while now i dont usually talk a lot about my feelings about the channel or even about the channel in general in like a meta way but youtube and making content for all of you really means a lot to me to us and even though there are challenges along the way and long weeks and nights its truly changed my life for the better and so when i think of an accomplishment or life event that would be important enough to me to have on my body for keepsies this channel is far and away the number one choice i mean tylers good too but ive heard some stuff about significant other tattoo jinxes so were not gonna go there right now so i thought if i was gonna get a channelrelated tattoo why not have you guys choose it or at least help me choose it because obviously you guys are a huge part of this channel and we wouldnt be where we are today without all of you out there watchin okay so this is what we did a couple of weeks ago we asked you guys to email in ideas of tattoos that you would like me to get and we received quite a few submissions in a lot of different styles some more simple some more photorealistic some more illustrated and a lot of them were original submissions so thank you to everyone who drew something for me some of my favorite oneoff drawings were this raven wearing platform crocs this bat wearing some of our questionable clothing items and this alien  carrying crusty along with a sephora bag speaking of crusty we did also see a lot of submissions that were of crustys face and body but after going through all of your submissions we narrowed it down to four options that reflected the most popular ideas that you guys had as well as the ones i liked the most as tattoos from there we chose examples that were in the style that i preferred which ended up being smaller graphic black ink simple designs and finally we put those options in a poll at the end of our latest video for you all to vote on so our first finalist was a black bat silhouette which i think represents me in my true form as a giant winged marsupial and i think that out of all of your suggestions bats were by far the most popular submission the second option that we put on the poll was an outline of a moon which represents to me all of the allnighters pulled in the last  months i wouldnt say i do my best work at night but i would say i do most of my work at night the third finalist was an alien head outline kind of like emoji style which has actually been on my youtube banner since the beginning of our channel there were a decent amount of fullbody aliens and ufos as well but i think that the simple head outline was my favorite choice and finally our fourth option on the poll was this cat and bats inside of a circle which represents another large section of the submissions that i would call the fusion category a lot of you guys sent us different motifs and animals mixed together like alienbats catbats moonbats catsandmoons catbatsbeingabductedbyaliens et cetera but when i saw this particular submission it really stood out to me just a simple black silhouette of a cat watching two bats fly off into the night so those were our four options honorable mentions go to the frankenphora lipstick hello friends and crusty of course maybe next time so i put those options on the poll and gave you guys a few days to vote i said early on that i was gonna reserve the decision of where the tattoo should go for myself and i ended up deciding on my left side ribcage which i think is a pretty cool spot but its also gonna be hidden by my shirt or bra almost all of the time so with that we were ready to head off to the tattoo parlor s all right so we are heading to skin deep tattoo and piercing in scenic glendale california  s and i am going to get a tattoo t yes t this is actually happening s is this real life i feel like david after dentist but its just safiya before tattoo as for who was gonna do it we met up with tattoo artist and youtuber kimmy tan who does a lot of tattoos in different styles including ones that are similar to the submissions we chose s so were here with kimmy at skin deep tattoo and its all happening so fast k yes it is
s like my voice just cracked s did you hear that
 k youre that excited thats good thats how youre supposed to feel before a tattoo youre supposed to be k excited and ready and you know mostly excited with this face right now ah yes so i think were gonna have to tell you the results of the poll now because unlike in the hair dyeing video i dont think we can make it a surprise so without further ado in fourth place with nine percent of the vote was the alien head i guess no one likes my channel banner thats fine in third place with twelve percent of the vote was the bat which surprised me because you guys sent in so many freaking bats maybe its just a loud marsupial minority our runnerup with  percent of the vote was the moon i guess theres only a moderate love for the creator of our planets tides and in first place with a whopping  percent of the vote was our fusion cat bats and moon tableau which makes sense because its kind of combining some of the previous options together but even though i would have been happy with any of the choices i was really excited that this design won because each element of it sort of spoke to me from the first time i saw it the little story of it in my head is that the cat is our cat crusty watching tyler and me  run around and be idiots while editing our videos in the middle of the night hence the moon s so youve been notified as to what the winner of the poll was as to what these guys decided that my tattoo s should be  um and youve been like doing some doodles s or kind of like iterating off of it
k i have been so as we had mentioned in the last video the illustrations for the options on the poll werent a hundred percent set since we wanted to leave a little room for kimmy and i to tinker with it k i got one with a little striped tail got some that is in a moon shape cause i think if youre gonna be getting it k on your ribs i think it would go better with like the flow of your ribs rather than just a circle that might warp k when you move your hands a little big s i love this one as well i like what you did with the moon in like the crescent and then sort of filled in the s rest of the circle with like little dots what do you think nice armpit shots t oh yeah
s most of this videos gonna be filled with armpit shots we deliberated for a while as to what the details should be like specifically about the outer circlemoon thing s would it be weird to have the branch coming from nowhere k its only weird if you think its weird you know what i mean there really are no rules to tattoos other than k dont get your boyfriends name yknow what i mean
 k so
s  youre out but in the end we decided on the crescent moon with dots completing the circle a little bit of a skinnier tail for the cat and more of a spindlylooking branch s almost like the seussian arm a grinch arm
t oh interesting okay   k ohhhh k now that you mention it when hes all like heeeyuhhhuh it does kinda look like  so with our design set kimmy sketched out the final draft and printed it into a stencil now i had looked at like a tattoo pain map before doing this so i knew going into it that the ribcage was not exactly the most comfortable place to get done it seems to be in the bring something to bite on region k kay lets put it this way have you ever been scratched by your cat s yes
k its pretty much like that s lets hope crusty has been vicious enough to me that i know what this will be like t that was your training so with some of our pain questions answered we went on to placing the stencil on my skin so kimmy had a template to work off of k good thing about the ribcage i dont really have to shave it s well you might have to shave mine just kidding k no youre actually pretty good you have a very unhairy ribcage  what does that mean 
s thats the nicest thing anyones ever said to me t weve come to the right place so after placing the stencil i really liked how it all looked k i think its awesome
t so this is it right okay were good thank you kimmy t well see you guys um cool
s alright thank you for my tattoo thank you but we realized that the exact spot that we had chosen would cause the tattoo to warp a lot with my normal arm movements so we decided to print another stencil and place it a little further back which would still stretch but hopefully not as much s oh yeah thats cool i think its a little less flexible back there though obviously still a little flexible s but like i can go backwards and forwards without it compromising the integrity of the design t there you go
s all right well lets go for it i guess so with that kimmy brought out the tattoo bed and it was time to get agoin s can my birkenstocks come on the table s tell me where you want me we had to tape my shirt back so it wouldnt get in the way s are you gonna do that thing where you like count to five but then you go on three k  no its not like a piercing i dont have to do that k alright im gonna start off with like a really small line first so just just so you can get what it feels like and k everything before i actually start and then it was time k here we go  s okay oh yeah it feels like a cat scratch okay
k right s it feels like youre just like giving me like a flu shot my first impression was that the pain wasnt quite bring something to bite on level s i might eat my words it doesnt hurt that bad but it also doesnt feel like awesome s i kinda feel like im riding like a soothing train you know cause theres like some vibrations so kimmy started off by doing the outlines of everything s alright tell me like what shape are you doing right now cause i cant see a thing k right now im doing his tail
s the butt t crustys butt is being permanently added to your body right now      s wow s that cat really he came a long way i actually very quickly ate my words because the tattoo got more painful as we got to different areas 
 k now im doing the branches
s i feel the branches yeah ribs in general are supposed to be a more painful area because youre closer to the bone versus like fleshier parts of the body that said kimmy did tell us that butt tattoos are apparently very painful so i guess thats not a hard and fast rule t you need something to bite on
s no im just flexing my birkenstocks thats my s how i deal with the pain besides birk flexing i did develop a couple of other coping techniques like making insane faces t you okay
s  im fine tyler and grabbing on to tyler as he was trying to film s actually poking you in the thigh helps me
t yeah   s yeah  t do you want me to hold your hand or do you just prefer trying to scratch me s i prefer trying to scratch you infinitely oh yeah this helps   t yeah s does this hurt you
t no s oh then it doesnt help me
 i dont think i did any actual damage to tylers arm but i feel like a little pinching was only fair t i think ive become a scratching post
k a human scratching post t this is like the chain of pain
 so once kimmy was done with the outline all that was left was to fill it in s alright and you said the filling in is not so bad k me personally i dont think the filling in is that bad but like i said everyones different so i guess well just have to see s this is a weird angle for me man wheres my hair even coming from so kimmy began shading starting with the two bats s tyler which bat do you think you are and which bats me t i think the bigger bats you cause i think the little ones chasing you around s then im probably the little one if the little ones chasing the bigger one around and annoying it t okay thats more accurate but after a little bit of the shading i actually found that for me it hurt more than the outlining s you cant film you cant film anymore 
 s i cant wait to review this footage and see all the crazy faces im making k if it makes you feel any better because you chose such a badass placement like for your first tattoo k your next one is not gonna hurt as much
s my next one im kidding k like my first tattoo was on my wrist and saf is just like balls to the wall goin straight for the ribs i dont think im going to be getting a second tattoo anytime soon unless maybe i can take tyler down with me k would you guys ever get matching tattoos
t of safs face s uhm
k uh of safs face s yeah just of my face i get my face and you get my face    as we got closer to the finish line i think i did actually need something to bite on so kimmy gave me some gum to chew s i have so much gum in my mouth that was like the biggest piece of gum of my life t thats a thats a pain alleveer 
 and to give tylers arm a break i started focusing my attention on visual stimuli around the room to distract myself s im just looking at this girl over heres birkenstocks theres literally a girl getting tattooed right there s wearing birkenstocks i relate for additional context i wear birkenstocks quite often and ive tried to contact them a few times but theyve thoroughly ghosted me s i was just thinking about how much i talk about birkenstocks in videos and how they just like dont s wanna talk to me ever t the company 
 t good thing were not tattooing a birkenstock onto you right now s thats true and apparently while getting a tattoo im salty about it s dear birkenstock this couldve been us
sk but you playin but before the tea could really be spilt although im not really sure i had any more tea to spill kimmy announced that we were finally done k i think were done
s  were done k i think so yup
s ohmygod amazing s can i stand up
k you can s i guess the question is not may i stand up its like am i physically able to stand up  k woo breathe youre probably a little lightheaded  in through ze nose out through ze mouth s i have so much gum in my mouth this is  gonna fall out s okay so i think its time for us to take a look or at least me everyone else has seen it   t yes so after about an hour of tattooing and a quick rush of blood to the head it was time for the reveal t you like it s oh my god it looks really good s oh yeah oh thats cool i think that kimmy did a really great job  and our final placement of the tattoo a little set back seemed right k and when you move your arm around so much it doesnt warp like we did it the first time s no yeah  this is definitely the right spot s i like that when i go like this it gets taller but it doesnt stretch sideways  yknow what im saying s ooh that hurt a lot  s but it looks good you did such a good job k high five 
s thank you so much k of course dude it was so much fun
s its amazing k you were so great she did not move at all she was great for her first time like seriously k can i give you a hug  you were so great ugh congratulations on your first tattoo so kimmy wrapped me up and gave us some aftercare instructions and with that i took my tattoo and headed home so thats my tattoo chosen by you its been a couple of days since we got it so its still in its crusting phase right now and itll be totally healed in about a month overall i really love this tattoo and because its so simple i feel like i could easily add to it if i ever wanted to though im not really in any hurry to do that what matters most to me about this tattoo is what it symbolizes so even though the title of this video kind of sounds like a shocking stunt im really happy that you all were involved so thank you again to everyone who sent in submissions even if your design wasnt featured there were so many great ones that i might not have wanted as a tattoo but like i do honestly want framed in my house also if you happen to be someone who doesnt like tattoos or doesnt like this tattoo well its on the side of my boob so youll probably never have to see it again unless maybe we make another fashion nova video or something thank you guys so much for watching if you liked that video make sure to mash that like button and if you wanna see more videos like this make sure to

thanks for watching christy and i will see you guys anext time  ♪ musical intro ♪ hello friends and welcome to another video today were going to be testing out questionable fashion hacks from instagram videos now weve previously tested strange hacks from facebook videos with mediocre success and then we also tested out some beauty hacks from instagram videos with just as middling results and since then not only has the instagram algorithm continued to place these short strange minimally instructive life hack diy videos on my explore page but ive also become more and more intrigued by them specifically these clothing and fashion related hacks which seem uniquely peculiar both in their scenarios and also in the time and equipment you would need to do them they seem kind of hard as i mentioned in my last hack video my biggest complaint with instagram videos overall is that theres no progress bar so theres no ability to scrub or partially rewind besides replaying the entire video every time theres also a culture of freebooting aka taking other peoples videos and reposting them to grow your own instagram page now i dont think that these fashion hacks are quite as traditionally clickbaity as the beauty videos were but as a subgenre they definitely prioritize shock value and animated emojis over helpfulness i would say they all fall into a few different hack families all of which have their own particular tropes first off solving a common or uncommon clothing problem these are kind of like old school infomercial style like what you should do when your fly wont close or your skirt keeps riding up secondly temporary transformation hacks where you quickly pull tie or fold an item of clothing to use as another item of clothing this category kind of makes the most sense to me because they seem the most time efficient but i doubt they actually turn out looking this good and finally destructive or permanent transformation hacks where in you cut up sew glue or otherwise permanently modify an item of clothing to decorate it or turn it into something else in particular they like destroying bras and yoga pants which are on the whole not cheap which always makes me wonder if you have the time and energy to cut up a pair of yoga pants and sew them into a halter top would it not be more cost efficient to just to buy a halter top i guess well find out lets start hacking alright so i think im gonna try and build an outfit with these hacks so first up were gonna start off with the undergarments alright so this video was posted by this page called diyhub but from the looks of the page i would guess that this is a compilation account thats trying to get followers by reposting freebooted videos so this video was probably posted from a bigger page but we dont know which one because theres no credit so the general premise of this hack is that you take some underwear or like boxer brief type things you cut them up and then it turns into a bralette somehow this hack is like sandwiched amongst a bunch of other clothing hacks all of which are in the general destroying family in fact actually the first hack in the video is them destroying a bra and then later they create a much worse bra or i guess we dont know that yet but t how dare you question the hacker s but that one seemed like a legitimate underwire situation and this one is underwear alright so i got two pairs of underwear because it wasnt super clear to me from the looks of the underwear that she uses if its like mens boxer briefs or womens boxer briefs im gonna start off with the womens pair of underwear just because maybe thinking about it this like extra hole is not ideal even though i feel like these look more like the pair of boxers she was using alright so basically what she does is she folds the underwear in half and then she pins the fabric along this line and then she cuts from the crotch to like sort of halfway through the underwear and then she does la sharp turn like an l tadaaa this doesnt look right t are we sure these arent crotchless panties s i think that to be honest the thing thats not gonna work is that i think that the legs of these boxer briefs are just to long so its gonna be more of like a capped sleeve bralette so this is the bralette on it actually doesnt look that bad t i like it s its a little bit like weirdly fitting around the arms because the sleeves are like longer in the armpit than they should be if you can see this i think that you just need like the perfect pair of like boxer briefs that have like very little leg to give you that good bra strap so im gonna have to try and either cut the legs off of this orand try to do these fruit of the loom ones as well alright so this is the delegged hanes bralette and here is this one with a bonus frontal peehole im gonna try both of these on then well see which ones better and wear that one alright so these are the mens fruit of the loom boxers and i think that the strap is like much improved but the armpit flaccid fabric is still very present its like if a bra had turkey neck and then this is our modified hanes bra which definitely has less of a capped sleeve now but unfortunately like there is gonna be just like some extra fabric around here but its better than the fruit of the loom pair so were gonna go with this one i think in general this hack does result in like something resembling a bralette but im not sure that the bralettes that result in the end is good enough that you will actually really want to wear it i can only forsee that this hack being used at a pinch at a time and place that where its wildly inappropiate to not wear a bra but totally okay to not wear underwear like right now you cant see my bottom half but you can see my top half ♪ ♪ ♪ hello friends and welcome to another video today were gonna be trying out a full face of japanese drugstore makeup so a couple of weeks ago we traveled to japan to film a few videos and while we were there we wanted to explore japanese makeup trends just a little bit i feel like i hear a lot about j beauty and we did try daiso makeup a while back but i wanted to try out some products that are actually used in everyday makeup routines so our friend rinrin who is a tokyo local as well as a youtuber and a lolita model helped us shop for some makeup products for our tokyo street fashion makeover and she also gave us some tips on what kind of makeup looks are popular in japan overall so we combined what we learned from her with a bit of our own research and went to a drugstore to purchase a full face of products to make our own japaninspired makeup look so the drugstore we went to is called ainz  tulpe and its located in the main area of the harjuku neighborhood pretty much right when you get off the train from what i can tell a lot of makeup shopping in tokyo happens in drugstores like these which are pretty plentiful all around the city there are also some freestanding brand makeup stores like mac shu uemura and anna tsui but these drugstores stock a lot of brands and products at varying price points so its almost like having an ultatype selection contained inside of a drugstore so ainz  tulpe has a lot of their bestselling makeup products on the main floor but the true treasure trove is downstairs on the lower floor where they have their full brand displays as well as tools and other miscellaneous items like foot care so we bought a bunch of makeup products as well as some duplicates just for backup if you see me buying multiples im just experimenting  we cant come back tyler no this is the only chance i got and a few extra fun things that rinrin had recommended and oh yeah we did all of this like the hour before we were supposed to leave for our flight back to la so good planning on our part all right we should actually really go to the airport probably tyler yeah were running late all right so we are now back in america so we didnt miss our flight and weve got our haul still in the bag from japan so weve got a fullfaceofmakeups worth of products in here so lets start off like we usually dowith the eyebrows so to start off ive got these sort of like eyebrowtrimming combscissors rinrin specifically recommended these rinrin there is like eyebrowtrimming scissors and people just like trim it and then just draw it in some people even like wax the tails off safiya another fun thing is ive downloaded a few translation apps on my phone so we can see exactlyor approximately what is said on these packages all right so on these little scissors google translate says the text is this point scooped and cut easily i cut it as a cush so i can do it with one hand that is easy to arrange you know its  very approximate the general idea is just saying that you can cut your eyebrows easily with one hand i mean it seems straightforward enough lets just dive right in oh my god im like about to do this all right so i think you comb up your eyebrows and then trim oh i am so nervous i got to start at the end oh that totally did something was that good or was that bad the tail is gone this is like a pretty risky experiment oohhh okay maybe i just have enough eyebrow hair that actually its not that big of a deal its actually just like cutting off like almost like the first coat just mowing the lawn here i wonder how these guys would deal with the sideburns not bad sideburn trimmer what do they say to babe thatll do pig thatll do scissors that was not an accent that anyone speaks in i do think these eyebrow trimmers are pretty good but its hard to know like exactly what youre cutting because the comb like obscures your eyebrow so i feel like you could really do some damage i just feel like my eyebrows are thick enough that like i was able to sort of just cut willynilly but like you can definitely tell that like some of the thickness is gone all right so next up is the brow powder so this is the natural powder brow liner oh thats fun yeah it could i also like this little mask oh i guess maybe you could use it as an eyebrow stencil but my eyebrows dont really fit all right so i guess im just gonna apply this i think its just sort of supposed to look naturalsmoked out imprecise in a way ooh its very dry it does definitely feel like im just putting sort of powder in there it makes like a nice asmr sound yeah ready i did get a more brown color than i usually do for my eyebrows because rinrin mentioned that like a lot of sort of natural brown colors are pretty popular in japan overall i actually kind of like this i feel like usually i have sort of a disney villain eyebrow going on and this is a little more of like an emmawatsonasbelle eyebrow strong yet soft tyler what you know emma watson shes got like strong brows right anyone and with that lets move on to the eyeshadow so ive got this excel eyeshadow quad in sort of like a rosybrownneutral color story tyler color story im trying something rinrin so a lot of eyeshadows in japan they have pearly finishes also a lot of neutralsbrowns like this sort of color is very big safiya all right so i think im just gonna go for sort of like a gradient look almost just like the darkest shade at the bottom and then just getting lighter as we go up i like that this is sort of a pinkthemed palette that doesnt make you look like you have pink eye you dont have any of that sort of infectious swash right so im just gonna highlight under my brow bone and i think thats like pretty much the look i dont know that i need to do that much blending because these colors arent super pigmented theyre more just like a soft touch of shimmer and color but i think that overall its sort of a nice effect and i think theyre pretty easy to use so now were gonna move on to the complexion products and the first product were gonna dive in with is this visee color controller and i got it in this pink color because usually i use like a peach color corrector under my eyes to get at that undereye baggage it looks like a little pen and on this side oh its a little puff i think i maybe twist it perhaps oh oooh did you get that tyler yeah i did okay are you ready for some spot treatment badow badow badow oh thats cool im just gonna use their end to sort of spread it around im just sort of like painting my face that doesnt seem right my fingers are definitely the better choice as theyre like blending it out more softly but this is a pretty opaque color corrector its definitely like bright but its not half bad so next up were gonna go with this kate stick concealer i couldnt really find a lot of liquid concealers around the drugstore but thankfully we could at least find this stick concealer i think that this is more for spot treatment rather than like slathering around your undereyes so im just gonna use this to like cover a couple of zits and then well move on to the foundation so next up is one of rinrins holy grail products that she said we should try the maybelline pure bb mineral cushion foundation even though its maybelline it is apparently not available in the us so japan exclusive but not america exclusive all right so im gonna use the puff theyve provided and im just gonna press in oh wow thats a lot and then press on oh i need to hold on stronger should i just dab like a beauty blender or shall i drag oh this smells very clean like a cleanandclear toner tyler that is what it smells like yeah i actually think im a fan of this foundation i think the coverage is pretty decent and i cant really feel it like its pretty light which is nice overall the finish is not incredibly matte but its not too oily or heavy feeling id call it satin my only real qualm with it is im just not sure how much foundation is in there right because it seems like such a small sponge and its such a small container i just i dont understand did i already finish it i cant tell all right so im gonna close the chapter on our cushion foundation that was pretty good and now were gonna move on to the blush so this is a cream blush by the brand canmake which rinrin described as a popular student brand there is a fair amount of japanese text on here so why dont we whip out our translate app once again and see whats going on ah what it says is blood sensation  exposure what i mean tyler what i mean i can only assume that theyre not really talking about like a bloodthirsty kind of blood oh things are going well like its not really like a dracula moment its more of like a thebloodisrushingtomyface moment and basically im just gonna use my fingers and dab it on my like upper cheekbones and undereye area oh yeah oh wow thats pink because thats definitely the trend right now that we noticed in japan rinrin under this area it just looks kind of like youve just done like a lot of exercising activity and was just kind of like a lively safiya the cream blush is also supposed to provide a little bit of a dewy finish since dewy skin is like pretty popular in japan rinrin like i saw that there was like a huge craze about glass skin in the us for a bit  the thing about this is that im just not sure when to stop you know what i mean how ham is too ham here like as pink as a ham all right i think lets go with this in general i do like the cream blush and i especially like the sheen it gives my cheekbones its almost like a highlighter without the shimmer its  its  so its like sweat its like you did actually just come from the gym all right so cream blush  acheck okay so really quick im just gonna dash on some of my own face powder just to you know get some help in here it seems like loose setting powder is actually not that popular in japan but my face oil runs in rivers and streams and im just  im trying to put up some barriers all right so next up weve got contour and highlight in general i think that contouringas in like cheek chiselingisnt super popular in japan but nose contouring is and rinrin recommended this to us to use as a nose shadow kit so weve got sort of just like a little powder palette in here and um im not super great at nose contour but you knowif its part of the look was that right i think i made my nose look more crooked than before because isnt the point of nose contouring to sort of make your nose look slender and straighter im asking the universe so im just gonna blend this out and blend it to the point of almost away all right yeah see its  its gone mostly so were gonna go with that as our nose shadow im not saying that you cant use this kit for a nose contour but i dont know if i can use this kit for a nose contour all right so for our highlighter i have this excel shiny powder in silver pink kind of to go with the whole pink theme thats been happening so im just gonna put a little bit on this brush right here and well just slap that right on there oh yeah that came in hard and fast the glitter chunks are strong with this one but it does sort of complement the shininess of the cream blush my cheeks theyre just like uh a lighthouse granting you safe passage to the coast theyre  thats how bright they are also though while were on the step of highlighting im gonna go back in to our excel eyeshadow quad and highlight my undereye area just a little bit this is apparently a very popular like makeup look in japan to make this little bit seem more puffy rinrin people can go like really heavy and also even do like hyaluronic acid injections to physically poof it up all right in general i feel like this effect makes me look kind of happy kind of like im like smiling and like my cheek is like going into my eye kind of you know what im saying like almost like dimples so with that done now were gonna go in for our final pass on the eye products and were gonna start off with the eyeliner so this is the mote liner which is like rinrins like holy grail product so im basically just gonna apply this to my lash line but then at the end instead of flicking up like a cat eye im going to drag the line downwardslike a not cat eye all right here we go i actually really like this tip its kind of like a brush tip instead of a felt tip marker which is always nice once ive got kind of like the whole normal lash line down then ill sort of drag the end down slightlykind of like that i guess right as we mentioned in our tokyo makeover video the droopyeye look is apparently very popular in japan rinrin it looks like youre kinder you know like in anime youll see like the kinder softer characters have this like droop to their eyes and then the more stern type of characters have this pointed look its actually a little bit easier to do like a droopyeye look you just kind of like  and i think after a few strokes this eyeliner definitely does show up quite nicely is that even actually i think thats pretty even huh i shouldnt try and fix it because thats what it always goes wrong all right so i think this is my finished eyeliner so next up were gonna go in with this eyelash curler which has like a little comb attached to the top ive never seen that before so i thought we might as well grab it also theres very little english text on here so why dont we whip out our translator to try and see whats going on all right so it says spread in fan shape with separate combs eyelashes will be beautiful without becoming a bunch in the gap thats pretty coherent this translator is getting better or maybe this text is just bigger so it recognizes more of it see the thing about an eyelash curler is i feel like it always looks mildly like a medieval torture device with the comb it looks even more like a deepsea fish or like a prehistoric shark anyway i guess well put this on my face now oh okay curling clamping so theyve got some of my eyelid but like its too late and  release what do you think cute i do think it looks a little curlier but not like significantly so all right im going in for the second eye now gonna insert my lashes thing is i dont think that comb is like getting all the individual ones its getting like a few in each slot and then im gonna clamp down and then release oh that definitely did something all right i might need to redo the other eye real quick to help it match but that looks pretty nice i feel like the eyebrowtrimming scissors did a really good job of separating out the individual hairs but i think that this guy was mostly just an eyelash curler with extra teeth for no reason so with our eyelashes curled were gonna go in with a quick sweep of mascara this is the mote mascara which is also one of rinrins favorites i will say that both this and the eyeliner have very sleek metallic packaging thats like kind of sexy ooh that smells like a marker but it looks kind of cool sort of um angled  all right lets go in shall we oooooh okay i like this mascara a lot actually its not super voluminous but i think its nice oh i just dropped that it is making my lashes look pretty long and also pretty separated the mascara i got was an impact o1 dramatic and yeah i guess on the top it does say that its a ten in length so whatever that means so i may have done this out of order but next up im gonna do my colored contacts i dont usually wear colored contacts but they seemed like a pretty popular item in the drugstore and they were right next to the makeup all right i dont think it matters which eye is which oh oh oohhhh theyre so floppy my contacts are like way more stiff these are like way wetter oh my god it definitely stings a little bit but i cant tell if thats normal i think its getting over time and i can actually see pretty well like right through the middle of them but around the sides its almost like ive got like a vignette filter on my whole vision hello tyler you look so romantic oh wow i kind of like this look to be honest i think close up it looks kind of terrifying but from far away it looks kind of fun i dont know if i could handle wearing these every day just because of the slight cloudiness but i think for a special occasion you could do something fun all right so thats pretty much our eye look so lets move on to our final step the lipstick okay so this is the canmake stayon balm rouge i apologize i already ripped off the plastic because i got excited it almost looks like a cherry chapstick i mean its called a balm rouge so it is almost like a tinted lip balm in a way and i think in general the japanese lip trend is to not overline your lips and kind of just keep it like blotted all right im almost blending this out with my finger and thats it tada in general this lipstick is almost more of a gloss but i think that it feels really nice it smells like pretty much nothing at all and i think it looks pretty complementary to the rest of the look canmake is also pretty affordable so its good for the price all right so this is my full japanese drugstore makeup look in general i actually really like this look its definitely very different from how i usually do my makeup and overall i think that japanese makeup trends are more cheery and puffyif that doesnt sound too weirdthan american makeup right nowtrends like my under eyes are a little puffy im sort of flushed around here im sort of droopy and kind of bitten in terms of which products i would use again i dont think im gonna be reaching for the nose shadow or the highlighter the highlighter is a little too glittery for me and the nose shadow is not quite beginnerfriendly enough for me but i think that the eyeliner mascara and foundation i actually will use again as for the beauty tools they were overall pretty highstakes feeling but i think that they were pretty solid there were also a couple of tools that we bought that didnt make it into the video like this ear cleaner that i got for tyler which im very excited to try just because hes behind the camera doesnt mean hell remain unscathed thank you guys so much for watching i

be getting a tokyo street fashion makeover yes were going to japan and were gonna be getting made over so earlier this year we traveled to three different us cities to explore how fashion differs in different regions so this time were so this time were gonna be taking our experiment international right over the pacific ocean i feel like japanese fashion trends specifically what ive heard called harajuku fashion or tokyo street fashion are talked about a lot online in videos and articles to the point where i definitely have an image in my head of what i think it looks like but i wanted to go to japan and see for myself so to do this were gonna be teaming up with a local who will guide us through three different current trends so we can get a little taste of what tokyo street fashion is all about now obviously this wont cover everything that people wear in tokyo as street fashion is pretty different from your everyday wear and this probably also wont even cover every inch of tokyo street fashion because from what ive seen theres a lot but were hoping to find three outfits that capture some of whats going on right now all right lets go so step one of our tokyo makeover was to fly to tokyo and while we were there we stayed in akasaka which is sort of a businessy area thats very picturesque green and quiet and it was also decently close to harajuku which is where a lot of the action is in terms of tokyo street fashion to aid us in our search we met up with rinrin who is a youtuber and a lolita model as well as being pretty well acquainted with the local tokyo fashion scene right off the bat rinrin clarified that tokyo street fashion tends to be a little different than the common western perception a lot of people tend to think that if you come to harajuku youll see a lot of people dressed in like lolita or the most recent style is like yami kawaii which is kind of a dark kawaii but you dont really tend to see that as much and for this video we wanted to focus on the current street fashion trends and not just on the more wellknown subcultures how would you describe tokyo street fashion today theres less emphasis on the silhouette and a more eclectic type of style a lot of people like to layer and express their creativity and put color into their outfits also harajuku is a neighborhood and not just a singular style as it can sometimes be presented which was news to me at least so im going to be showing you three styles that are a general idea of what youll see on the streets today with the first trend being the vintage remake style which centers around transforming old vintage clothing a lot of kids like to take these items and cut it up and add things onto it so theyre very oneofakind styles the second trend being the minimalistic mode style youll see a lot of people wearing this and layering black on black that sounds like my my type of thing sometimes i like to dress up like a bat would a bat look work there no never mind and then the third and final trend the colorful layered style you can layer things on so much and things are transparent and things are like colorful and its basically you could play with anything you want so without further ado we were ready to start shopping for our tokyo street fashion inspired outfits and our first stop was the store a nincompoop capacity which specializes in vintage remake so an in a nincompoop capacity is located in the oda wadda neighborhood which means that its just behind the main part of harajuku its a more hipstery type of vintage area hipsters theyre everywhere the store itself is a former cigarette shop tucked away on the third floor of what looks almost like an apartment building inside pretty much every inch of it is covered in vintage paraphernalia from the  onwards and a lot of it is recognizable ip with a little bit of a twist looking around the store many of the remade items are sort of like vintage tshirts spliced with tutus and though theyre not all tshirts the general vibe seems to be bringing together in congress pieces into one garment to make something completely new usually with a new shape as well we were also able to ask the stores owner mr ohashi some questions about the vintage remake style he led off by saying that there arent really rules about shape or style within the trend itself he doesnt like tell people what to wear he says theres a lot of people who wear it like formfitting or just totally loose its all up to you what you see here and you just kind of put it all together and in terms of what is in the store it seems that mr ohashi does a lot of the curating and his wife kathy does a lot of the cutting and remaking so where do you find like your inspiration like when you see a piece like how do you know if you like it or if you want it to be in your store that is a very hard question so his inspiration comes mainly from punk so music as well as the vintage fashions which actually makes a lot of sense because theres a strong emphasis on diy in punk style in terms of what i should be wearing mr ohashi recommended that we just walk around the store and see what caught our eye you always do this huh yeah its a kind of like a devious mischief afoot immediately i noticed a bunch of breezy tunic style tops i know you said bats were not in but it might be like an unconscious bat yeah absolutely the bat just slides in and as if on cue the next thing i found was this oh oh its a nike shirt with batwings yes get that yeah it seems like fortune had smiled down upon me mr ohashi and rinrin also found a really cool headtotoe pink outfit and i found another blousy top that seemed to have been made from like a college sweatshirt they didnt think i would be here then we grabbed a couple of bottoms to match our tops including a black skirt for our nike outfit all the world all black know im trying on other stuff too well we have to have one all black stay with the brand and a pair of embellished jeans for our central state university blouse and with that we were ready to start trying on our outfits ill be back alright go did they like the governador here so first up was the headtotoe pink outfit yeah this look definitely had a strong visual impact and i think that the different shapes and textures were really cool i like the little butt apron its very different but i think its fun like nope dont look here then to top it off mr ohashi styled me with a little knit crown weve got a little like where the wild things are situation i love it like this oh its so cute hahahaha and despite how pink it was i actually really liked it you look like you belong in the store im never leaving but our second outfit top some stiff competition so i think that this is definitely like more in line with like my personal style i feel like the skirt im not sure what im doing with it despite the skirt being a little unbalanced the top is amazing and as if i needed any more convincing rinrin decked me out with some accessories he he he how do i look after trying on both of these looks i was kind of conflicted because i feel like part of the style is like what you like but i also feel like maybe just because the other outfits more different from what i usually wear it feels more like the style you know im saying transformation exactly a style transformation yeah exactly but we did have one more look to try on here it is central state university i thought this top really accomplished the vintage remake objective by transforming a simple college tshirt into a romantic almost renaissancesy blouse its like sort of a shakespearean in a way and i really liked the jeans which featured some nice rear lace action though i wouldnt say they were really transformed into a different shape or garment the jeans are like pretty normal but embellished in terms of which outfit i liked the best i was still torn between the first and the second look i thought the first one definitely made a very big impact however i do think the second one its very you so it looks good i think we maybe want to change the bottom for that one goes a bit short for balance purpose so we purchased our bat outfit thanked mr ohashi and were on our way all right so now having explored the vintage remix style a little bit you can move on to our next location which is ground y ground y why is it not the air no its the ground so next up we went to ground y to explore our second street fashion the mode style ground y is an offshoot label by yohji yamamoto located inside of the laforet department store in harajuku which has a lot of local trendy designers and boutiques now when you first walk into ground y its very black and white which i think is in line with yohji yamamotos general vibe for reference yohji yamamoto is a japanese designer described as a master tailor who is known for his androgynous and avantgarde designs usually made in black sounds like my kind of guy and in general hes considered an important driver of the mode style so to help pick out our mode outfit we met up with rinrins friend mika who is a mode enthusiasts and instagrammer so mode style i would say its kind of defined by a monotone color palette i would say is very unisex or genderless which is a very big thing going on right now in general and i think that androgynous vibe influences the shapes and cuts of the clothing with most of the outfits being unfinished flowy or boxy yeah i always loose like simple yeah like oh simple and minimal so with some sense of what we were looking for it was time to start a shoppin im still there always are you doing this again yes i was shall we do that again yeah ready well do it again my cousin like sneaky sneaky so right from the start i was a little confused by some of the items at first glance they seem pretty simple but when you approach them a lot of them have unique cuts whats this like an extra arm hole its open so i think its just a flap okay just a flap so the first outfit that rinrin and myka picked out was an asymmetric jacket a white buttondown shirt and a long pants skirt hybrid ooh kind of like a suit yeah next up we found a blue buttondown sheer dress oh we need an inner yeah too sexy too sexy to see through which we d sexified with like a matching blue shift dress underneath and for our last option this looks yeah i recommend this we went for a white maxi shirt with a geometric pattern on the right shoulder what would you put underneath this like for pant um no this button yeah just oh just like a long dress yeah a long dress which gave us three mode options to try on so first up was our threepiece suit i like like the asymmetry you know what i mean its kind of like off center because mode style pretty much ignores the curves of your body the designs tend to play more with draping asymmetry and abstract shapes and to finish off the look mika recommended that we add this wide brimmed hat oh yes oh wow i can hear myself im like echoing off the hat overall i really enjoyed this outfit im not usually a hat person but this look made me feel kind of like a boxy carmen sandiego all right ready for the next one yes i dont know if youre ready so up next was our blue sheer dress is this sufficiently desexified yeah youre so not sexy right now perfect that is the goal i feel like this was more of a summer mode look im feeling easy and breezy with the blueness and with the lighter flowy or fabric rinrin also thought that a backpack might suit this outfit so we tried on this very round one turtle shell can i be a ninja turtle youll be leonardo yeah the blue ninja turtle oh there you go this dress was definitely cute but i just wasnt a hundred percent sold on it so we went on to option number three oh this looks nice yeah i love it this outfit combines elements of the first and second look and there was also a fun secret there are pockets yeah youre a little going 1 2 i didnt notice before so we accessorized our long maxi shirt to complete the look and though we all liked this one i think we were kind of missing some of that oof from the first look alright so i think that weve decided that were gonna kind of combine the first and the third outfits by putting this jacket over the last outfit which i actually really like i think this is like the best compromise because its like pretty much the vibe of the first outfit except without the pants so we went with our hybrid fourth option as our mode outfit thank you so much mica for helping us know youre on call so whats next were gonna go to wall which is another boutique inside of the same department store its right on the other side of the wall im so sorry that i said no but its its literally right next door all right so lets go so unlike ground y and an incompute capacity which focused more on a singular trend or aesthetic wall carries clothes from a range of designers that reflect a few different trends the concept of the store is japan in ten years its also one of rinrins favorite stores and in fact the dress shes wearing here is actually from wall but what we were searching for was an outfit that would exemplify what rinrin described as the colorful layered trend all right well lets get to it yeah so one of the objectives of this trend is to just wear a lot of different garments basically piling on as many clothes as you can and often time with extra appliques or fabric stitched on to or hanging off of the layered garments would you even call this maybe theyre like nap yeah napkin flowers no lotus are more open i think you know i have no idea yeah what are you orchids we never did figure out what kind of flower it is my best guess is a campanula flower dont at me but regardless we needed to find a bottom to complete our first option oh my gosh its like pants but pants wow theyre pants that have been eaten by other pant extended pants and yes they are also littered with embroidered mice i needed to try them on youve heard of pizza rat have you heard of thigh rats pizza pizza rats the rat that like was dragging an entire piece of pizza in the new york subway subway yeah while shopping we also encountered another aspect of the trend which is that a lot of the items are loose and oversized look at those sleeves its not quite a batwing its almost like a manatees flipper im not sure we could in good conscience follow up the mice pants with the manatee jacket but we did find another oversized item this long and patchworked tshirt oh you know what that looks like a baggy  teenager yes almost like the guys at chers high school in clueless and to pair with it we grabbed some also patchworked jeans and for our third option we wanted to try something that was a little more vibrant to make sure we got to the colorful part of the colorful layered look oh thats really cute i like the pink but i want to layer something over it of course we must we must so rinrin grabbed this dusty rose slip from off of another hanger we couldnt find another layering piece so were just done for diy yes and with that completing our third outfit we began attacking our pile of clothes i love the rats more than i thought i would if you can take a second to not look at the extended mouse pants rinrin and i also really liked the top its very spring im a blooming flower and though ill say i did enjoy the rats i think it just overpowered the other layers too much its not called the colorful rat trend so we moved on to our  high school boy outfit there we go i was surprised by how much i liked this look for some reason i feel like pretty comfortable in it that might be because its a giant tshirt but i feel like pretty like yeah like that i can wear this around this was also a big hit with the shop staff at wall who suggested we accessorize it with a bold graphic earring though we were feeling pretty good about this outfit we still wanted to try our last one on for good measure which actually turned out to be no easy feat it took me so long to get into this you guys rinrin like came off like a harem i like had to help me do this what i will say about this outfit is that the undershirt skirt thing is super cool and i love the sleeves yeah but i think that the over layer is like a little tight on my booty oh no sexy which i dont think is the vibe were going for as we mentioned with the layered trend you usually want things to be oversized and flowy and though i think we had the right idea with the layering unfortunately those ideas were just eclipsed by the booty so we decided to go with a little bit of a mashup for our final look alright i think we nailed it so this is the second outfit with the jacket from the first outfit on top of it i think this kind of brings everything that we liked from the second outfit and then just adds another layer on top of it what do you say i think this is the perfect one so with rinrins approval we got to our final tokyo street fashion outfit so now we have three outfits that embody like three different tokyo street styles but we dont have any of the finishing touches like the makeup or the shoes and stuff were gonna do a little um exploring and see what we can find and then well see our finished looks for a quick shoe stop we dropped by a store called tokyo bopper to pick up a pair of stumpy shoes to pair with the mode outfit and the next day we went with rinrin to a drugstore to grab a couple of products to put together a tokyo inspired makeup look so what i wanted to incorporate this time is a trendy like pop of color since were heading into summer the focus of this makeup look is definitely the eyes as we added some highlighter to the lower lids to make them look bigger and used some turquoise liner for that pop of color that rinrin had been joined so you already have that droopy eye look which is an ideal look heres to bring your eyes down it looks like your kinder oh thats a very nice thing to say thank you we also applied some cream blush on my cheekbones and under eyes im hoping the cream blush will like bring in that dewiness since dewy skin is a popular goal in a lot of japanese makeup looks and then with a dash of semisheer lipstick you were ready to go but this is definitely a summer look im not gonna say like this is like the general like tokyo street fashion look do i look summerry like a sweet summer child yeah so the first street fashion look we took out on the town was the vintage remake outfit which included our remade batwing nike top these fluttery adidas pants the pants have some flair in fact theyve got multiple flares and a pair of black combat boots that i had brought from home on my face i was rocking our pop of color summer makeup look and for my hair rinrin had gone ham with some bobby pins the sideburns on full display so for this first outfit rinrin was able to come out vlogging with us for a bit you guys are the bat twins right now so she could help us take street snap or style photos of the outfit i dont get hits up in harajuku photographers will line up on the main street and to ask passerby who they think have cool outfits on to take photos of them hence streets now seeking street snaps of me and richard together and there was like a dude almost its just posh as hell all the time i think that overall this is probably my favorite outfit its definitely like more shapeless than i would usually go but besides that like its pretty up my alley im not usually one to wear nike sportswear but thats because they tend to not have giant bat wings attached so in this case the vintage remake style has bridged that gap for me you look so dramatic but comfortable at the same time this is comfortable vampire i may have also felt at home in this outfit because it reminded me of some of the unusual clothing items weve tried in the past this outfit is kind of like if the band ruffled tshirt and the y project like longsleeve denim jacket had a lovechild i think it captures a lot of the fun of the giant oot sleeves without the added danger of hitting someone with a large denim tube the only real obstacle i could think of with this outfit was that because theres a lot of stuff hanging off of it it feels like you could accidentally dip it right into your food or drink i think we did okay with our ramen this time but its definitely something to look out for so next up was our mood look im a mode gargoyle exact like a nova babe for mode hashtag mode gargoyle for the completed outfit i donned our white maxi shirt asymmetric jacket wide brimmed hat and these shoes that we got at tokyo bopper for my makeup i substituted the pop of color out for some plain black eyeliner though i kept to the cheeks flushed rinrin also suggested that we could slick my hair back for this outfit but my hair has to be curled for the wall outfit and theres only one time that the hairstylist could take me in so its currently even though this look is color wise definitely in my zone i would say that its much more formal and structured than i would usually go i feel kind of like a business casual dementor but nonetheless there was something theatrical about it that i loved in particular the hat was like the best prop part of you is birdlike yeah and it kind of gave me a personal cave under which i could perform my mischief come under the brim i dont like there oh my god here i will say it was a little sweaty probably since it was late may but the nopants aspect made it bearable at least so ive got swamp bra but not swamp butt but despite any swampiness i actually enjoyed wearing and vlogging in this outfit the most maybe even though i wouldnt wear this entire outfit together in the us i might wear this entire outfit together in the us you should and our final street fashion look was our colorful layered outfit from wall which included our oversized tshirt patchwork jeans and yellow unknown flower jacket so for this outfit rinrin recommended that we accessorize it with white sneakers that i have brought from home actually because my feet are rather large for japanese sizes these orange earrings that we also got at wall at laforet and some curly hair i also subbed in some yellow eyeliner to match our jacket now for all three of these outfits we were vlogging in the same area of harajuku which happened to be just a few subway stops away from our hotel so we kept going there because we knew how to get there though i think that this outfit matches the aesthetics of the harajuku neighborhood itself the most closely like with this giant teddy bear now that is some seriously layering and this amazingly cute multicolored ice cream
tyleri think as is getting more melty we should get that away from our layered clothing though this outfit is definitely the furthest away from my usual style and not just because of the color but also because of the silhouette and texture yeah though i didnt mind being a moving pile of laundry and i like how it flows as i moved i weirdly like this sort of like kilt at the bottom yeah the half kilt the only thing i didnt really like about the layered look was the effect that the layers had on my body temperature as in i was warm warmer than i was even in my fullon mode suit but theres a nice breeze coming down this alley yeah kind of like opening up the air ducts i had to fight the inclination to take off some of the layers its supposed to be the colorful layered look so i had to stay layered but i think that for more everyday wear ill probably dawn these items separately as i like them all individually specifically i love with pants which you can barely see yeah all right so those were my tokyo street fashion looks even though these outfits are supposed to represent three different trends there are some commonalities between them that are kind of emblematic of tokyo fashion in general all of them are sort of like long and in general im pretty like covered just to provide i guess like maximum area for more layering and theyre all also kind of asymmetric this one is a little sort of half kilt and all the other ones have their own little asymmetric flairs i think that all three of these outfits are pretty different from current us fashion trends at least the ones im aware of and rinrin seems to be right in that theres more of an emphasis on layering and draping and the clothes seem to skew a bit looser overall though regardless im excited to bring these looks back to the us because i feel like i can incorporate different items from them into my own wardrobe and in some cases just wear them head to toe exactly as is were going to make mode gargoyle i think if its the last thing i do thank you guys so much for watching and a big thank you to rinrin for helping us out with this

sure to shamash that subscribe button a big shout out to rochelle for watching thanks for watching rochelle and i will see you guys anext time  if this video stops randomly in the middle its because we dropped our camera in the water hello friends and welcome to another video this week were going to a spa theme park in japan yes were going to japan and were also going to a spa theme park so what exactly is a spa theme park its not a super clearly defined idea but its basically a mashup of a traditional japanese hot spring spa resort a good old water park and a dash of pr baby features you may have read about in like a  article spa resorts are actually pretty common in japan for thousands of years onsen or traditional hot spring spas have been a staple of the japanese skincare health and relaxation routine being a very volcanic country japan has a lot of naturally occurring hot springs and where there are hot springs there springs forth a desire to soak in them but this particular spa resort yunessun has taken it to another level not only with the waterpark aspect but with baths full of wine green tea coffee and fish that nibble on your feet amongst other things so we decided that while we were in japan we had to stop by and try it out not only to get our first fullon onsen experience but also to see if there might be some hidden benefits in bathing in all of these different liquids all right lets go so our first step in getting to the spa theme park was to of course fly to japan now we had scheduled our spa day for the second day of our trip so we were very much still in the throes of our jetlag fever like  hours the unison spa resort is actually located in hakone a which is an hour and change outside of tokyo where we were staying so we thought it would be fun to take a bullet train to get there this is the footage i got from trying to give you guys a tour of the bullet train station which almost caused us to miss our train clearly it was worth it so japanese bullet trains are pretty well known for being one of the fastest train systems in the world traveling up to  miles an hour you can feel how fast youre going and with our booties thoroughly rattled we arrived at odawara station a quick  minutes later where we caught a bus that would take us all the way to the spa look at tyler showing us what bus were getting on very demonstrative walking on tyler i like it unison itself is pretty high up in the hills so the bus ride got pretty raucous the road was winding and narrow and our driver was quite fearless but it was a good way to get pumped for the spa so from the outside unison kind of looks like a big beige hotel but its surrounded by some of the most beautiful mountains that we could finally appreciate because we werent flying around at the sides of them its so pretty out here 
t i know when you first walk into the ground floor of yunessun you get a little taste of their theme park branding theyve created these mascots which kind of look like felines spongebobs that are speckled throughout the park its like someone relaxing theme and then its like a grumpy cat with a beard as you can see the entrance is just like the hull of sponge cats so to get into the park we had to go up a few floors passed a series of lobbies a giant gift shop and a number of crane toy machines until we finally reached the actual entrance where they immediately have you remove your shoes what theyre like you cant take those hammer toes in here so the park itself is broken into two sections one is called the morenot you or the naked zone where men and women are separated and one is the swimsuit adair eeeh which is where the more water park and more key attractions are were going to the naked part right now we need to monetize that we had gotten to the park a little early before the naked zone opened so we could film in there by ourselves without the aforementioned nudity and also so tyler could come as well this is nice i want a churro but dont worry we got permission to do this over all the naked section is more about rejuvenation and relaxation which i think captures more of that traditional onsen vibe obviously im wearing a bathing suit for youtube reasons but youre supposed to get your onsen on in the nude all right chuckling wash off you get no tongues so am i doing well give me s were sitting is were naked people said sometimes in the naked zone there are about six different kinds of baths that i could try out four of which are filled with warm or hot plain spring water including the first bath right at the entrance next to the showers if you like a talent or a do this fully wood lined indoor pool which is almost like a sauna because of how hot it is and it smells really good it smells woody i dont know how else to say that youre like piney i dont know other wouldnt mahogany no i dont think that this large outdoor communal lagoon and these personal porcelain bowls look just like their own like personal images its like the teacup ride at disneyland the like actually teacup you dont get dizzy you dont throw up you grow up on that right they do have a couple of specialized waters back here in the naked zone as well though including this green tea bath which i think is just spring water but they steep a rather large tea bag im talking about mountain dews baby in general bathing in green tea is supposed to help your pimples and pores and has some antiaging benefits as well im not sipping tea i am becoming tea it they also had a summer special collagen bath which was filled with roses ecology besides smelling like a face mask collagen is supposed to improve skin elasticity and fight aging by promoting cell turnover i did the collagen is like counteracting the sun its like aging anti aging youre really drink the koolaid huh well im trying not to drink the cool overall i found the pools very relaxing but the big winner of the naked zone was the view of the mountains and though we had ventured to unison mostly for the more unique experiences im glad we got to get a peek into the naked zone to capture some of that thousands of years old traditional onsen experience and now that theyre about to open this naked zone to the public and people will actually be making here were gonna head back out and see whats out there now when you first walk into the main part of the spa they have like a foot and knee rinser which kind of took me by surprise like a bidet for your knees one yet i do i have not used one yet it was tylers loss there are a lot of very nice bidets in japan now the central chamber of the indoor section has one giant pool in the middle of it which id call like the neutral watered communal ill look in there some bells look at that but building on the onsen vibe it has like a warm bath temperature there my thighs hello thighs thighs out skys out besides that id say its pretty standard so we wanted to move on to the more exciting waters i want to show up my wedded chess hair to all of you nasaan could you leave so first up on our list of specialty pools was the doctor fish foot baths were a school of garra rufa fish a variety of turkish toothless carp nibble or i guess vacuum the dead skin off of your feet oh these guys are ready for action now ive seen this before online and it seems to be pretty popular in many east and southeast asian countries like get your hijab funyuns so basically what you do is you sit at the edge of this tub and dangle your feet in like i can smell it okay take a girl and you havent a lot of time of  minutes ready im ready oh yeah some action shots yeah this would be like shark we would fish it vikings up your feet the doctor fish are incredibly tickle inducing im feeling like really disheveled some of them sort of traverse your whole leg and others just pick a spot and go at it they really like my feet i think thats not a compliment in a particular tylers right foot had a disturbing number of fish on it might be versus on speed but before his foot could be consumed entirely or ten minutes were up friday yes i actually do think that the fish got some of the dead skin off of my toes but i probably would have had a more thorough pedicure had tyler not been hogging all of the carp theres like not dead skin on my feet right now theyre chunks too not when were in a little like creeper so unison has like a schedule of events and at specific times they will pour coffee and red wine directly on to you in their respective pools and we had a bit of time before the next coffee pour began so we went to check out some of the smaller themed pools next door the green tea and the saki bats youre not supposed to drink the sake or the green tea i say that to me so we went to the green tea bath first which was pretty different from the green tea pool outside oh really that one was just like normal spring water with a green tea bag and this was like a scalding cup of tea im guessing they mixed this one with something else or just like diluted in a bit but in general the tea was just too hot for me hey soph yeah youve spilt tea everywhere so having mildly boiled the booty we then hopped over to the saki bath which was noticeably a much better temperature well i like this thats nice i like the ones that are like warm but not like too too hot sensitive five sake could be good for the skin and meta can help exfoliate and lighten dark spots and bathing in it is actually a traditional geisha skincare secret on the side of the bath was sort of like a giant sock a drum but i think the liquid in the bath was pretty diluted from the smell and feel of it i dont know that you could like get plum in here because there are a bunch of kids in here earlier though on the side of the barrel was a true sake spigot so apparently this little knob here shoots out a little sake and drinkable im gonna get sir shoot me the face youre not usually supposed to drink the sakae straight out of this nozzle but the unison employees who are escorting us around encouraged us to try it dont photoshop this you get a little bit put your hands out there so you can catch it there we go yeah heres my sake baptiste yeah yeah thats good sake but after our sake taste test it was time for the coffee bath you almost fell it at the camera im hammered the coffee bath itself is just kind of like very watery coffee though it does smell and look pretty accurately coffee ish in terms of its skin benefits there are some antioxidants in coffee that can help detox your skin and the caffeine actually combats puffiness and i feel like also just gets into your pores and wakes you up you know i dont know theres recibo or what but as soon as i walked in here i was like eight lets go the big event at the coffee bath is the coffee pour and what happens is that they prepare actual drinkable coffee in these giant buckets and men dole it out to the crowd theres monster ladies oh yours was a drink it i just threw it on my face no it was good so i tried to coopt some of tylers portion for drinking purposes actually and after a decent amount of the crowd had tasted the coffee they then proceeded to throw entire buckets directly at us its good its very tasty they did this quite a few times im not sure if the skin benefits are amplified by the coffee being thrown at you but it is exciting idea what kind of footage and i did feel pretty awake afterwards so the final unusual bath that we wanted to try was the wine back which had another pour type event later that afternoon so we decided to visit the outdoor portion of the park in the meantime on the way we passed a few additional pools that looked pretty plain but it turns out that this was the location of the ramen baths which were a pretty popular attraction last year in which park goers bathed in pork broth and collagen im kind of salty we missed it so the outside of the park has some of your usual waterpark accoutrement like slides and kiddie pools and waterfalls with the added bonus that the view is pretty freakin ridiculous we four went to the childrens area for the waterslide i got a behavior rinse off because i really smell like coffee can you see it yes i can amongst my hairs its like coffee stuck in your mustache on your shoulders unfortunately they didnt let us take our gopros onto the slide but i guess that did spare everyone from having to watch a very slow water slide shot which i think was just our problem because other people were going down much faster but nonetheless we do have a second angle on this shot if you want to see it following the slide we went through like a hot springs grotto which was mostly just a series of shallow pools but you could see the waterfall from behind as well as this gemstone thing that they call a marin rose but from there you can walk through to behind the waterslide where the observation pools are coming these are basically like a series of long skinny pools alright and once again a warm pool very warm that oversee the mountains as well as unison itself down there is tyler and then there is the spa resort the view kind of made the observation pools my favorite part of the park but after bobbing around a bit and film like  pans of the surrounding landscape we had to head back inside just like you know i love these kids are getting wasted tyler kept making that joke as for the skin benefits of red wine its got some antioxidants for some antiaging and also some antiseptic properties for some anti acne i thoroughly enjoyed the red wine pool though it did seem to be the most diluted of the specialty pools for example this giant wine bottle that spraying my head is completely just water but for the wine pour itself they went for the real deal like with the coffee they started off by pouring some red wine into your hands which by wine standards was a pretty decent amount unlike tyler who chugged it i voluntarily threw it in my face hoping for some quality antiaging then they proceeded with a more direct port which i think tyler thought he was supposed to chug again it hit him pretty quick they concluded the show with another round of throwing a full bucket directly into our face with the wine bath complete i think we had actually hit all of the specialty pools so we threw on some complimentary scrubs and slippers and got something to eat all right hi whats up next were getting buffy now lunch dude grab and then well run their buffet had a pretty good spread and was a nice cap on top of all of that soaking and afterwards we caught the tail end of a parkwide aqua workout class so after  baths lunch and a workout i think we had thoroughly investigated our spa theme park and were ready to head back to tokyo how do i go yeah lets go it was really fun so we caught our bus back down the mountain hopped on another bullet train which you can really see the speed of here but thats the best right and needless to say we were home in a speedy  minutes well from the train station of course alright so we are back at our hotel room now and im feeling pretty cooked we had a great time at the unison spa resort but i feel like ive just been steeped for so long in so many different types of liquids that i just need a nap overall our experience at the spa theme park was very positive though i think the things i thought were the most exciting before i went were not actually my favorite parts i thoroughly enjoyed the quieter parts of the park like the naked zone and literally all of the amazing views of the mountains one thing i thoroughly enjoyed which we didnt include very much in the main part of the video were the mascots i like this one cuz it looks like he has cheese on his head but they were kind of cute lee speckled all over the park subtly this sneaky guy look at him so sneaky and not so subtly say and rio is quaking is that still a mean i think that after this trip we did feel sufficiently spod whatever happened to sponge bob that cured him of the suds i think happened to us yeah i mean i think that we do feel softer and i think there was a logic behind each pool as to why they would be good for your skin i think that we soaked in so many things that were not going to be able to pinpoint like if our skin is better like which one it was yeah helped us but its sort of like the cumulative experience of just like you know sort of rolling around in hot water and feeling good and tired it was quite a trek so itll be difficult for us to return but if youre down for about  hours of travel wed say its worth the trip or also if youre in japan already maybe that would be good thank you guys so much for watching if you liked that video make sure to smash that like button and if you want to see more videos like this make sure to shamash that subscribe button a big shout out to vicky for watching thanks for watching vicky and i will see you guys next time music music this is safiyas new intro song music hello friends and welcome to another video today were gonna be buying and trying an entire face of makeup from wish now if you dont know what wish is its an ecommerce marketplace that sells pretty much everything at really low prices and ive bought a few things from there before including clothing items listed as free and tech products and in general i would say the hauls were pretty hit or miss with the clothes being a little more hit and the  electronics being a little more miss but ive always been curious about the supersuspiciously lowcost makeup listed on their site so today were gonna order some and see what happens when i put it on my face i wonder how many things im gonna buy from wish before i learn my lesson alright lets head to wishcom my old friend wishcom so wish has its own like makeup  beauty tab so lets head over there so first up im gonna be looking for the complexion products so the foundation and concealer straight away im seeing what looks like a bunch of tampons but i think those are hair curlers im also seeing like a waist trainer and a lot of hair removal products maybe thats next mustache removers from wish so i finally stumbled upon a foundation after scrolling for a while this is a longwear foundation that kind of looks like rihannas fenty beauty foundation but theres no way its fenty beauty foundation for 2 it has three and a half stars on  reviews and on sizing apparently someone said it was too small i dont know what that means interesting no one who left a review seems to say that like anything bad happened with the foundation the only problem people have had are with the shipping or with the pump so um maybe this is decent foundation who knows and it turned to 4 as soon as i added it to the cart so it did that fun wish thing where the prices just change randomly alright so thats gonna be our foundation so lets grab a concealer really quick and then move on to the more um artistic parts alright concealer where art thou concealer seriously so many waist trainers so many teeth whitener kits edible lube good im glad thats in the makeup section i might have to search for concealer alright this is definitely concealer and this one is free sort of looks like the nyx concealer that ive used before the thing about seeing like makeup products for 1 or for free is that it makes me think of like all of those videos and articles that have been done about fake makeup or bootleg makeup where like theres very strange and questionable ingredients in them so admittedly getting this may not be the best idea but well see people seem to like this though it has four stars on  reviews i only see one comment that the smell is a bit strong but everyone else seems to be into it except for a couple of people who havent tried it and yet still decided to review it and then in their comments said havent tried it yet alright so lets look at the color selection no swatches to be found so im gonna try color number 2 because its light but not the lightest alright im gonna add this to my cart and thats gonna be our concealer so im gonna go in for the eyebrows next alright so it looks like theyve got a lot of listings for normal looking eyebrow pencils this first one looks great its free and it says that  people bought this so its called the waterproof eyebrow pencil pen eye brow liner cosmetic makeup beauty tool lasting waterproof eyebrow pencil and i say those like that because theyre all lowercase for some reason interestingly enough ive had pretty good luck with super lowcost eyebrow pencils before so i kind of believe that this could be a like really popular product so lets pick this up in the color coffee so thats gonna be our eyebrow product and im gonna add that guy to the cart alright so next up lets look at some eyeshadows i would love to get a little bit of a palette just so we can you know have some options  play the field a little bit lets take a look at these ones these are 4 eyeshadow palettes and they kind of seem to be like sort of imitating the anastasia beverly hills modern renaissance palette theyre kinda like square pans in rosy colors oh weird theyve got a bunch of different styles of palettes like completely different palettes that were not even shown in the listing back here alright so it looks like the palette that i originally wanted is style p number 1 so thats gonna be our eyeshadow alright mascara is what we need ooh i dont wanna go with her cause she seems like shes a little in pain because her eyelashes are so overwhelming the interesting thing about these makeup products is that there seem to be a lot of like different listings for what seems to be the same product or at least like the same product photos so im not sure if theyre all like different mascaras or if theyre just like the same mascaras being sold by slightly different vendors i think im gonna go with this mascara cause theres a cat on it its 1 and it has four and a half stars on  reviews im having a hard time finding anyone who will say anything bad about these makeup products so im not sure if i should actually be reassured or suspicious chuckles with that said lets add this cat guy to the cart real quick and move on to the eyeliner ooh and right away this looks really fun and there seems to be a lot of listings for it its a sort of like doubleended felttip liquid eyeliner with a stamp at one end and like a marker at the other it seems a bit safer than trying to stamp eyeliner on your face with scissors so lets try this instead people seem to be liking the stamp a lot so hopefully that will be fun to play with and well see if it makes you know getting the perfect cat eye any easier i also hope it just works in general but hopefully it also helps with getting the perfect cat eye lets add this guy to the cart real quick and move on to a different area of the face so lets start off with some contour stuff i usually like to use powder contour so that would be my preferred method this looks like it could be a contour palette lets take a look ah yes this says up 6 color pressed powder palette nude  color camouflage concealer make professional cream palette wait so is it a pressed powder palette or a cream palette cause it says both oh i think that like the eyeshadow this has like different listings for products as different styles under the same product listing and i would guess that this image is of the cream palette and this one is of the pressed powder im just hoping so im gonna go for style 2 although its not clear which of these palettes has 4 stars im actually seeing a couple of negative reviews down here one from caitlyn who says that the product definitely has a smell and one from joan who gave it one star and said i havent tried it yetbut i love it alright so lets add this to the cart and call that our contour alright so lets get some blush some rouge rrrr so straight away there seems to be a few listings for this blush so lets click on this one that at least a thousand people have bought alright so this one is a little bit less highly reviewed its got three and a half stars on  reviews although when i look at the actual written out reviews they look good except for two people who say that theres no lid and the product just comes like completely exposed so lets take a look at these colors i think lets go with number 7 tipsy i feel like that kinda looks like my kind of blush color though ture love seems fun because i think that they misspelled true love alright so thats the blush lets do highlighter next i usually prefer a powder highlighter and there do seem to be a couple of those but this listing right here looks to be a 1 dupe or knockoff of the cover fx illuminating drops this has four stars on nine reviews and miranda says that it works well lets hope that mirandas right of these colors i think im gonna get sunlight so im gonna add that to my cart and well definitely compare that to the real product when it gets here alright last up the lips straight off the bat there seem to be a lot of like matte liquid lipsticks theres like a liquid lipstick set called niceface snickers oh interesting this listing seems to be like a lip kit like it looks like it has a liquid lipstick and a pencil this is the waterproof matte 1 pc liquid lip cs lip liner pencil smooth lipstick long lasting cosmetic makeup kit so its unclear if its a lipgloss or a liquid lipstick but its something and also a lip pencil oh and coincidentally this is also a niceface product i keep thinking casey neistat whenever i say that move over kylie and baby casey niceface is on the scene so just to compliment our rosy face im gonna go with this like pinky purple 2 color alright so im gonna add this to my cart and i think with that weve got a full face of makeup in our cart right now so the next time you see me ill hopefully have all of my wish makeup here and also hopefully not be damaging my skin too badly ok so its been a couple of months and i finally have all of my wish makeup items here so after all this waiting and anticipation lets dive right in and start with the brows so this is the dream godess eyebrow pencil it looks like a pretty normal eyebrow pencil though when i open it up it looks like theres no spoolie the pencil looks pretty good so i can spool myself if needed alright so lets go in on the right brow right now its a little more subtle than i usually go but you know maybe thats good thats fair alright im gonna go in for the second brow i will say it feels like i have to press down a little bit to really get some pigment off of this eyebrow pencil but once you go over it a few times it definitely shows up eventually and i would say the ending result is actually pretty nice so i think that the hoards of people who seem to like this eyebrow pencil are pretty much right you just have to remember to pack your own spoolie ok so with our eyebrows done lets move on to the eyeshadow so this is called the we care your favors  shades fullfunction palette i give care to favor you and here is the actual palette it smells like that oldschool putty that you used to squish inside of a plastic cup to make fart sounds just one thing to note before we go in is that they spelled moonlight moonligh alright im gonna use bisque as my base shade and put that all over both of my eyes and then next im gonna go in with indian red oh thats showin up its not like super soft and buttery but it is providing color to my eye im also going to throw a dash of salmon on there i did not mean to go so orange but it just sort of started happening there is a second salmon thats just like a a gold color i dont think so maybe its like the color of the water rippling above the fish as it migrates north to mate isnt that what they do yeah and to finish it off im just gonna put a little bit of moonligh underneath my brow bone ok i think thats an eyeshadow look i think in general these eyeshadows seem to be ok i wouldnt say theyre like stellar eyeshadows but theyre definitely serviceable the shimmers do show up a lot better than the mattes though and yes there are three mattes there not just two ok so up next are the complexion products so the concealer that we ordered is the farres cosmetics hd high definition concealer which i think looks pretty similar to my nyx hd studio concealer to be fair this isnt a complete ripoff like theyre not pretending to be nyx but it seems like theyre pretending to be a similar product now colorwise they dont look the same but i dont think thats the reason not to like the farres concealer texturewise the farres concealer felt a little bit more greasy so well see how it feels on the face it smells like hotel body lotion like something you huff dont huff alright so im gonna blend this out and it seems to be disappearing but it doesnt feel as greasy as it did on my hand alright i wouldnt say my undereye luggage is really covered but like its umits got a little veil and then next up is the fenty beauty foundation so this is the real fenty beauty foundation and this is the fake one and though theyve tried their best with the font and the color scheme the bottles look nothing alike they also have copied all of the text so on the back it says it was made in italy and also that it contains  fl oz but like is it possible that those two bottles contain the same amount of stuff maybe but i doubt it and then in terms of the swatch the fenty beauty is like extremely watery and this is like a little gel it smells kind of like cake batter alright here we go im going to dot this around and then blend it out the color is not horrible it seems to be working for me its definitely like a little bit more tan than i am but because its not super fullcoverage i think im getting away with it im also noticing this strange thing where i find a spot on my face that seems like it doesnt have foundation on it and then i try to put foundation there and foundation wont stay there alright so i think thats my fenty beauty foundation in general i dont think that the color matches too bad and it actually doesnt feel too bad on my face but it definitely looks pretty shiny and it smells cake batterish so next up im just going to bake this down with my real setting powder just to give it a little bit of a fighting chance against my oily face and then we can contour i think this is the contour theres nothing on the outside but based on process of elimination i think this is the contour palette tada why did i say it like that laughs tada its a lot smaller than i thought it would be for like size comparison heres my beauty blender it smells like a brand new rubber bouncy ball you just bought from the toy store it also smells kind of like a pool noodle alright so im gonna take this color over here and use it for my contour so im gonna suck in my cheeks and go to town alright i think that after a little bit of working that into my skin we definitely got some color payoff you know i think that its performance on the face is definitely better that its appearance and smell in the pan so before i blend this out im gonna go in with my blush alright so this is the focallure color mix blush in the color tipsy and it appears theyve sent us not a blush but like a refill pan which may be what those girls in the reviews were saying about how they just got like it without anything covering it i was expecting it inside of a compact but eh its blush i guess oh that first sweep looked like blush oh my god this is good blush sorry i sound so surprised ok so i think this is our finished cheek look though i would say that the smell and the presentation of the contour palette was pretty odd i think that it went on ok after a little bit of negotiating and i think the blush was actually pretty good so lets go in with the eyeliner now alright so this is a doublesided eyeliner its got the marker on one end and the stamp on the other so im going to use the stamp side to create a wing and then you know use the other side to fill it out eh ah ah its not great but it definitely could be worse it is pretty pigmented though at least it didnt like you know half stamp alright ready im gonna the pap smear no laughs alright so im gonna draw in the rest of this line and then im gonna try and do the other side to match the tip just does become a little bit flaccid if you pull it in the wrong direction i dont think that the ending product is half bad but im not sure that the wing stamp makes this eyeliner a lot faster because there is a decent amount of fixing work you have to do and also with the marker side its decently easy to use but the tip does get a little bit sort of smushed besides those things though i do have eyeliner on my face and my eyes havent fallen off alright so next up is the mascara which is our sweet cat max volume mascara oh its a really cute cat oh  what is that smell it smells like if you had an acrylic paint that was fig newton scented its definitely not like a super super dramatic lash but it is defined and not too clumpay i dont think the formula itself has a lot of punch to it but its not clumpy and its catthemed what more could you want in a mascara the answer is nothing alright so our second to last item is this faux cover fx highlighter so i went out and got the actual cover fx highlighter and its hard for me to tell the difference at least when theyre in the box out of the box its a little bit easier to tell as for the swatch this is the actual one and this is the fake one i think maybe the fake one has a little bit of a thicker glitter chunk but its very hard to tell all of these products smell so strongly like this one smells like hairspray so for that reason it almost smells like a dance recital ok there that is unfortunately i think its more of like individual glitter specs than a sort of nice copper sheen and on my hand its strangely dried down whereas the original cover fx is still sort of moist i dont think its horrible but its definitely more glittery than the original and it just it smells like ballet class and rounding out our full face of wish makeup is the casey niceface lip kit ooh its maybe a little bit more purple than i expected it to be so uh hopefully it goes with our look here alright so im gonna go in with the lip pencil first so my first impression is that this hurts just a little bit but besides that it seems to be pretty pigmented and now time for the lipgloss that smells like caramel popcorn alright lets go in this is a liquid lipstick  this is not a lipgloss its drying down pretty fast so i kind of have to work quickly alright so the color of this lipstick ended up turning out a little bit differently than i thought it would but my main complaint is the texture the butthole is a little wrinkly but with the lipstick i think weve completed our full face of wish makeup and im gonna wear it for the rest of the day see if uh my face falls off or if i get really oily or what happens alright so its a couple of hours later and i think in general the makeup is doing ok above my nose are pretty much all the products that i thought worked pretty well below my nose the foundation is sort of worn off right here and also my lipstick is kinda coming off so i would say that around here things are going well and down here things are a little more questionable alright so its been about six hours since i applied my full face of wish makeup and i think actually its wearing better than i thought it would at this point my foundation has definitely gotten a little bit oily but everything around my eyes has pretty much stayed intact so i think my favorite products were the eyeliner pencil the mascara and the blush and my least favorite products were the highlighter and the lipstick although a few of these products did work for me something i would point out as a reason to not regularly buy makeup from wish is that some of these products and a fair amount of these products i saw on the site are fake or like counterfeit versions of actual makeup products and a lot of them either dont list the ingredients or list the same ingredients as the makeup theyre counterfeiting so you dont actually know whats inside of them and unlike with other products from wish these like really interact with your skin and you know your skin is your largest organ so you might want to be kind to it also all of these products smell kind of weird my face kinda smells like a cracker jack cake batter chlorine combo and its weird thank you guys so much for watching if you liked that video make sure to shmash that like button and if you want to see more videos like this make sure to shmash that subscribe button a big shout out to glg for watching thanks for watching glg and ill see you guys anext time hello friends and welcome to another video so last week or i guess like two weeks ago at this point we traveled to new york city the big apple new york is that how new yorkers speak christine im in new york use my code for  off for the youtube creator summit where we got to hang out with some of our youtube friends who for some reason dont live right next to us like christine and ben from simply nailogical and corinne and rob from threadbanger and we all thought hey our travel itineraries overlap like two days and we have about six hours of collective unbooked time lets try and film three collab videos so we did and here is one of them so about a year ago christine made this video testing out a childrens nail art water marbling science kit and it turns out that this company project mcsquared also produces an edible eyeshadow science kit so i thought i like bad makeup science christine likes childrens toys and corinne likes food well most of the time so i bought three of these edible eyeshadow science kits and took them to new york with me where we tried them and this is what happened oh and yes this was before i cut and colored my hair again and also um if youre wondering where we are right now were actually in tokyo filming a bunch of videos so just pretty much ignore everything thats happening visually in this intro just focus on the nonsense thats to come so im here with corinne from threadbanger and cristine from simply nailogical hello and were gonna be supposedly making edible eye shadow youve done this before right im an expert at testing childrens toys and science of course in the name of science mixin color science fill science eat science i mean to be honest ive probably eaten eye shadow before i feel like i end up eating a lot of stuff accidentallyor or just sometimes i just taste stuff sometimes yeah i do too i think thats called its pica or something where you feel like you have to taste everything mmh that reminds me of that my strange addiction episode yes where there  was a person addicted to eating her husbands ashes oh my god maybe that was her grandmas ashes no and murders him again you could make eye shadow out of ashes too i think you probably definitely could yeah next video grandmas eyeshadow all right so it says cornstarch which is derived from corn imagine that wow is a common ingredient in lots of makeup by combining it with a bit of powdered sugar and water you can create a paste that works as an eyeshadow base my favorite part of actually the entire thing is that there is no image on this box with the girl with the eyeshadow on she looks the same in the eat and in the where image ah yeah im also curious to see how many instagram likes we might get out of this oh thats a lot of likes the packaging suggest here that almost a million likes to fill your eyeshadow palette i honestly didnt even see those but i love that the most likes that she has is on just the palette itself and not the photos of her face awesome so should we open these guys up i feel like weve just been holding them in like im very excited i cant dont show my nails otherwise cristine will roast me again do you want to open my box oh yeah ben usually does it wheres ben tyler can you help me hes good at this he opens stuff sometimes there you go great service thank you sir its very unclear what is actually included in this theres a lot less in here than you would think so weve got basically an eyeshadow palette two measuring spoons a little cup and some instructions look at this gorgeous beveling wow so chic so scientific wheres the milliliters so weve got all our crap out and i think that our are you are you okay she already broke it it looks like the first step is to get the cornstarch out which i had to buy separately cornstarch powdered sugar more sprinkles more sprinkles food coloring and more sprinkles theres essentially nothing to this eyeshadow kit except for just like a holder wait wait wait this also says do not allow the eyeshadow to come into contact with your eyes i love when they say that yeah thats really creepy and its like food coloring may cause temporary staining of the eyelid or the eyeball probably the eyelid all right so the first step is in a mixing bowl pour 1 tablespoon of cornstarch and 3 teaspoons of powdered sugar do you notice how theres also no measurements on any of these spoons which one is the teaspoon i know the instructions says tablespoon but which one yeah theyre both on the table that was a terrible joke im leaving i said theyre both on the table so which one is the tablespoon yeah ooooh and then i said im leaving im leaving thats it someone has to leave all right here here you go have some cornstarch and corinne here you go have your fix and then yes the next thing after the potion tyler laughing then the next step is 3 tea spoons of powdered sugar so then it says to mix with a spoon i feel we could just mix like this to be honest oh yeah to be honest it doesnt smell edible smells like home depot or lowes sorry excuse me well just bleep out what i said smells like lowes lowes home improvement ok im mixed is everyone mixed yep yep so this next step is to pour 1 to 2 drops of food coloring and mix with the dry ingredients im gonna make purple what youre stealing my color bitch hey you dyed your hair blonde its not your color anymore she leaves us with the shitty colors sorry i can change my color no no its fine ill make teal so you can make purple what where did it go theres no way thats enough it said 1 to 2 drops and i put 4 all right so im gonna do orange so im gonna go christine style and do 2 drops of yellow 2 drops of red oh yeah it solidifies almost instantly maybe it doesnt activate until you add water i feel like the water is really gonna help it itd be nice if they explained the science yeah wouldnt it so weve got water it just says pour a few drops in so oh yeah thats not very accurate okay what is a few boy thats a few that was more than a few there you go there you go thats a paste its green did i put too much water shit whyd i go first ill just add more of this a little bit more pasty oh yeah like me im pasty okay oh did you wash your hands first we didnt do that step uh oh what wait where do we have to wash our hands under important information i love it i didnt read any of the warnings whats going on there look at it its like playdoh oh oh that look that looks good actually oh i want to put this on my face it smells like pancakes oh like like american pancakes like not good ones well how does the canadian pancake smell like rich nice and real maple syrup delicious is there a difference besides the maple syrup oh dont get her started im leaving me okay so christine did a little too much so im gonna do a less all right i am definitely closer to to it that is weird slime oh yeah all right all right corinne oh man its scary that doesnt seem like enough ah it looks galaxy though oh that looks pretty good thats kind of cool i mean i think its gonna match my outfit really well do you want to just film how this is expanded look wow yeah totally like a horror movie hold on im investigating it is growing at a rate of point three three millimeters per second let me take notes oh the metric system we dont know what youre talking about im digging im excavating im looking for good content wow so the next step says ask an adult to wipe the compact clean we need an at all oh hello do you have science with you oh thats a good better oh god the tacos what do you think he ran away all right the next step is to press down and flatten the mixture into the container with clean fingers oh yeah look at that wait we should share yeah thats what i was thinking we need it you know a nicely balanced a color snoring maybe that would be pretty that is what yeah yeah yeah didnt you know that were actually all just nikkietutorials oh no i actually am know so we decided to share all of our colors so we could all have like a complete palette but in the meantime christine has powered ahead christine you are just secretly adding things oh that does look pretty though this one is a tide pod the earth is flat the world is on fire and each a little bit we know that christine is a flat earther all right heres our eyeshadow palette this is what i have arrived at i think that i tried to go christies style and add some in but i think i miss mess mine up too yeah i went awry sabotage im a little bit confused as to if these things are supposed to dry or not because on the box it says let dry but on the instructions it says nothing of the sort i dont know if we can trust or anything i dont trust like doing believe her she looks a little too happy so i think actually looking at how this is drying its gonna take a little bit longer than i thought to actually dry down into some type of eye shadow something well
we cant put sprinkles on it and then kind of like take it back to the hotel and like leave it in the fridge overnight or something i think thats good plan okay so i think were done making our eye shadow palettes well theres still some experimentation i got over here science is never finished so i think were going to let them dry overnight and then in the morning were gonna just you know put them on and also eat them i am very hungry now i know we had these tacos yeah sitting right in front of us i also like that robin ben came gave us tacos know then i left yeah all right so ive brought the eyeshadow kits back to the hotel room and im gonna stick these in the fridge and then maybe before we go to bed ill just take them out and leave them out to dry i also want them to get some good air  i dont want them to stay moist all right so here are the eyeshadow palettes after about  hours i know that i said we tried them on this morning but we kind of got busy filming some other stuff so its the next night they did change a lot huh well um heres the thing it was a lot prettier in the car when i closed them they did get a little messy yours was much more pretty than it is currently but its still cleaner than both of ours so that makes me happy better yeah the thing is they dont seem to have gotten like super dry in the way that i thought an eye shadow would theyre just sort of like crusty are you eating it already sorry christine well its weird because the box definitely step three was eat and then step four was where how could you wear it if you have already eaten it penguin eye shadow rather you eat the krill and then they regurgitate it and they use that i think tylers trying to science on this arraignment yeah stay out all right thought you want to grab the camera please just come back please fill this video for me i always say i was slighted so we dont have to eyeshadow brushes because i dont know we all know that all right so what should we eat it yeah cuz we got our little excavators out of the side ill just use my fingers with my beautiful name oh yeah you do have your own excavators i want to try the purple one because i feel like it will taste more like grape all right for some reason all right so its supposed to kind of just pop out but its really scraping out like its almost like the insides arent actually hard the way the surface is oh yeah kristines is good im a scientist yeah are you trying to take that out to eat it thats the plan cheers cheers oh no thats a note from me though it does not taste like grape the weird thing is mine does taste like grape yeah its mental im telling you its synesthesia great it tastes like baking powder to me it tastes exactly like when you put too much powdered sugar on top of fruit and you end up like eating the wet powdered sugar yeah thats like thats exactly what it tastes like yeah its not like really a candy or like really food but its its edible exactly christine is eating sprinkles i like fun the sprinkles are edible okay so it tastes okay but lets see how it does as an eye shadow to the bathroom together girls always go to back together so we got on the bathroom here all right so what its out of the box was to wet the brush then dip it in and then put it on the eye okay they also said to not have sprinkles on so i need to freaking carve off some sprinkles no fine all right so ive wet my brush and im just kind of putting it in here it does seem to have stained the brush just a little bit so im just gonna go like in the crease oh id be nervous too fuck mike well theres color there its more like a very very pale i shadow milk and that may be there for a couple days good im glad that i placed that artful i wouldnt know what happened if i just patted it out a little bit oh yeah none of the things that is coming right yeah what do you think how do i look what do you think damn it i didnt even need to do it theres a little something every you want to go next yeah i think im gonna go for the purple great since you did green theres something yeah that is a corner and crease i actually dont hate it i kind of like that yeah its a glassy look thats on trend now actually the aussie eyelid i feel like when it dries it wont be as glossy obviously you will it dry i know its kind of like dripping into my eyes yeah it stings its like sticky too so i feel like my eyes sticking together because of the sugar you know my eyes a little reds out i think thats like part of that look though you know like im gonna wake all night legs so my eye is already watering because these ladies are just so beautiful no allergies its hard being a beauty guru so im thinking ill put on some lipstick yeah you might have to zoom into my lips im going im going very small oh that was a clump of something its thats all it is oh wait were getting some spread itch if you rub your lips together it all comes off i see a little stain ajay dont know i think it is almost definitively a better lipstick than an eyeshadow okay  it feels drying though thats what im noticing like this is like a liquid lipstick but drier and i hate no when i  it definitely it starts feeling like sticky no one will want to make out with me oh thats not true christina we can still make out come here show gallop all right so those were our edible eyeshadow kits i think as eyeshadows they were like a little bit disappointing i think that the smoky color looked a lot better i didnt hate it but unfortunately like the sugar and the pain as the sugar enters your eye doesnt seem worth it it does i think as lipstick though obviously its not ideal but i think it makes more sense than as eyeshadow kind of because if the plan was to eat it anyway then its a lot closer cuz were you gonna like lick her eye or something not really make sense right shall i it might be a little weird i think that as a science toy this definitely disappointed me there was nothing in the thing that said anything about science i didnt learn anything but i couldnt say it i do think that i shadow science is a cyber slayer but the emulation of makeup overly but what is this this is not that no no just any little tidbit would have been better than what we got which was barely any instruction othing yeah no actual affirmation because girls cant handle that this is true despite what youve seen here today alright so this is

you like these ladies make sure to check out our collapse on their channels on percys channel we did our nails in the subway and on corrines channel thread banner we h some instagram foots around in new york city a big shoutout to lauren for watching thanks for watching lauren and ill see you guys next time bye hello friends and welcome to another video this week im gonna be getting a so called perfect makeover based on my features aka my skin tone hair color eye color and face and body shape growing up i always used to see these articles in teen magazines with titles like how to dress for your body type or what haircut flatters your face shape or which lipstick goes with your skins undertones and though i would often read them i never really applied them to my style choices opting instead for then long hair frosted eyeshadow and late  miniskirts and henle shirts and now what i would call my comfortable vampire aesthetic now obviously i dont a hundred percent buy into the idea that you have to wear certain things just based on peoples advice on what goes well with your features but i thought it would be interesting to try and get a headtotoe makeover based off of these commonly held conceptions to see one how different it is from what i usually do and two if theres anything i can incorporate to flatter meself more that i also actually like so with a combination of some research and some help from a couple of experts hairstylist and youtuber brad mondo and style guru stacy london im gonna be getting a new hairdo a new outfit and a new face of makeup all designed to flatter me well specifically my body and also my face to new york city we go so first up is hair so im here in new york city with brad mondo brad hi     who is a hair stylist and a youtuber you may know him from such hits as hair dresser reacts to americas next top model makeovers whos better me or her  but hes also done a couple of videos about like the best haircuts for your face shape and the best hair color for your skin tone so i figured hed be the perfect expert to help me on my journey yes im so excited to your hair this is gonna be amazing and were gonna make it perfect for your skin tone for that face shape honey that doesnt mean were gonna have to say goodbye to the gray hair but you know we had like a good month uhhuh i had like a good like five or six weeks with his hair and im feeling good its unreal yeah it has been real were gonna say goodbye today so first up was the cut which i wanted to get to suit my face shape got to pull this hair off your face were gonna accentuate her good parts and diminish the bad parts theres no bad parts but the sideburns is what he means from what i can tell there are six basic face shapes you can have combinations or variations of them but these are the six that people usually start from they are oval oblong round heartshaped square and diamond to me you definitely have more of a heartshaped face because your chin kind of goes inwards to a point and then it kind of gets wider on the top so the ideal face shape is an oval for a female because its symmetrical all way around with the same width at the forehead and at the chin given the fact that i have a heartshaped face the idea behind a perfect haircut would be to give the illusion that im actually an oval what i want to do is take your hair up to around the collarbone ooh we ran out a little bit of layering around her face just to kind of accentuate the jaw more keep all the weight kind of heavy down here to bring attention down here and then keep the side part the way it is perfect so before the cutting began we had to get my hair wet which was a bit more of a challenge than we anticipated first we had a sink malfunction i dont think it work oh and then when we found a usable sink can you fit back there girl it was a pretty tight squeeze for brads thighs i dont thats gonna get high its like okay oh its waking me up oh yeah oh thats what i like to feel we go and then we were ready to commence the cut i love chopping off hair its so satisfying almost awesome you had it short so the last time i cut my hair was december of  sht know that youve done a bunch of americas next top model like makeover reactions but i love when they like cut it off and like hand it to the girl and shes like nahahahahah like hysterically crying cassandra why you crying hi love my hair im not sure that my cut was antm level dramatic but we were actually getting rid of a fair amount of hair ooh yes it looks so good im gonna shave it up for this so that would be a surprise but listen if it suits my face shape i guess we must we didnt actually end up doing any shaving that day but we did end up getting to that long bob length he had described so we just finished cutting for the most part were gonna blow dry it and then im gonna do a little bit more refining im very excited about the length i feel like a lot lighter the ends have been living for a while like the ends are theyve  been living theyve been dying yeah theyve been dying okay so whats next bronze the color now the best part the most fun part which we based around my skins undertones which are the colors that come from underneath your skin to affect its overall hue these are mostly interpreted as being either warm toned aka yellow peach or golden or cool toned aka blue pink or red but there are also a couple of combination wildcard undertones like neutral and olive and honestly ive never been able to figure out what exactly my undertones are i know that in your video where you were like talking about how to figure out your skin tone you said to like look at the veins on your arm yeah whats that about so usually blue is cool and greener veins is warmer tones so looking at my wrists my veins do seem kind of blue which would mean that i have cool undertones but i also see a little bit of green in there or like at least teal so we decided to rely more on my face than on my wrists i mean i definitely see paint in your skin but i also see warmth so what im gonna say is that your skin is neutral but more on the cool side basically that means you can pretty much pull off any hair color oh no so brad decided that we should just warm me up a little bit with some lighter brown highlights you know just that really pretty sunkissed natural looking color thatll make you look really healthy and glowing im down for that were still gonna keep her in the brown family not too too light but its nothing to be different than what you have now he started off by bleaching the spots where we wanted the highlights to go were paintin girl were just doing some bob ross we had to deal with my natural dark hair as well as the old gray dye so overall the bleach was definitely the most time consuming step tylerhow would you cut my hair no no i like what you have going on like i like no i  saf well just because if you guys see what tyler looks like at this very moment so returning to my hair journey hello we finally finished applying the bleach oh you are getting blonde and your hair lifted just like perfectly so all we had left to do was to rinse i never thought id be a blonde and yet here we are and add some brown back in brad were definitely gonna tone her make it a lot darker than it is so it looks natural still these are the oh my god wow but unfortunately we were running out of time because the youtube space closes like right at 9 pm were the time crunch girl speeds scalp massage im a fan can you just like take a moment to appreciate my stance right now im completely horizontal in like an only moderately sexual way bradmakeover video cut sexual saf its more like gone obgyn prenatal stance aside we were getting close to the birth of my new hairdo im very excited its gonna be a change thats what lifes about right change evolution a personal journey yet towards death and with that done we had to go thank you youtube for letting us film here but were about to get kicked out so were gonna head to tylers sisters apartment nearby to finish off the job i promised brad were not trying to abduct you alright were here and bradish is putting a second toner i mean just a darken it up just a little bit more and then were gonna go in for the finishing cut we once again ran into some trouble trying to actually wash my hair which staying true to form required some contorting and also some ab exercises my cores woking then it was time for some final snips and layers a quick blowdry a few curls and an led panel to just make for a little bit more of a dramatic reveal brad i cant see with these glasses on  but its fashion and then it was finally time for me to see my perfect hair wow its definitely very different from what we started with but i really like it i love the length the length is everything and i like these little pieces oh it looks really good no i just i just look im hello so in the end the layered long bob that we ended up with brings more weight to around my chin and it has a little bit of a sideswept bang to take away from my forehead and the lighter brown highlights have both warm and cool tones to vibe with my neutral complexion all right so you would say this definitely fulfills the requirement of a hair makeover thats suited to my features honey one hundo posent thank you so much for having change you killed it thank you thank you that was we both killed it a week high five for a strong makeover so that took care of our perfect haircut but next up we needed to find our perfect outfit so im here with style guru stacy london whos gonna help me figure this out stacywell were gonna try were gonna try so basically im looking for the perfect outfit that will flatter my physical attributes the best you know sort of like take into account my body shape and my skin tone and like my complexion coloring that type of stuff yeah
so stacy whos been a stylist for many years and was one of the hosts of the tv show what not to wear is definitely aware of these types of feature driven clothing rules but her actual personal guidelines for style are more openended every item of clothing every piece of makeup every way you cut your hair which looks great by the way thank you has to do one of two things thats the criteria it has to be have a use value for you and your closet and it should bring you joy at least one but ideally both i dont know if you can read my mind necklace but it does say being perfect it does its quite nice but for the purposes of this video i do just want to be like a set of features kind of like a glorified mannequin okay so lets start with the first thing how do you dress now i would call my current style comfortable vampire like i said that is when i have not heard yeah so right off the bat stacy let me know that she thought my complexion was suited to more color than i usually go for stacy you have incredibly beautiful skin tone you have big eyes in this this color of your hair all of this lends itself to color and one thing that people used to do this is like so  is to tell you like what season you are based on your color saf i was hoping youd bring this up because i have never been able to figure it out stacy thats because people arent seasons seasons are seasons right saf there are a lot of old school metaphors that are used when categorizing ones features there are the seasons for complexions which stacy mentioned as well as fruits and vegetables used when referring to your body shape whenever i try to use these metaphors i feel like im always stuck between autumn and winter for coloring because i have dark hair but pale skin and i usually guess pear for body shape since i have small boobs but a decent sized badonk okay i know you dont want to do these things yes would you tell me what season and what fruit i would be that someone else would say okay stacy i would guess that somebody would say that youre an autumn okay saf which generally implies that i have warmer skewing coloring with dark hair and brown eyes stacy and because i cant see your body shape yet i cant tell you what fruit you would be youre also not a utensil so im never gonna call you a spoon or a fork or knife saf i dont know what is which one is that stacy listen i im an old dog ive heard every trick so in order to truly figure out which fruit or i guess utensil i am weve got to take this sweatshirt off and put you in something else and take a look at the shape of your body all right so i have my tank top on stacy you actually have my tank top on thats true ah its her tank top stacy so heres the thing im looking at your body and its pretty straight up and down right so im not gonna call you a knife im not gonna call you i dont even know whats a straight upanddown fruit a rhubarb a celery thats not a fruit but still its um in the edible area well you dont curve down at the bottom so i wouldnt call you a banana either saf so from the front stacey concluded that i was more of a knife but once i turned to the side she got a better view of the rump  
 stacy youve got a great high ass  okay so we want to fly i mean these jeans also just get a look at this this is what happens when youre young theres no puckering here this is this be i miss these days i gotta be honest with you now im looking at that and i would say oh okay maybe youre a little bit more than you carry your weight on your bottom half but what i would definitely say is that your weight is not on your top hat no right its not there but the i mean but thats not to say you dont have good boobs because you do one of the things that you have in your favor as dora licks your feet is that you have nice broad shoulders so what you may not have in terms of chest size is still very complimentary in terms of balancing your bottom half with your tops but i dont see a defined waist and thats the one thing that i would say would most determine the way that i would look at your body right is that we need to create a waistline for you to have what we call a classic female form which is hourglass now that doesnt mean you have to have it but generally speaking thats the way clothing is cut for women so much like my haircut was meant to oval eyes my heartshaped face stacy recommended that we find cuts that changed my rhubarb shape into more of an hourglass shaped fruit or vegetable like a deformed tomato or something or what about a bok choy its kind of got like a bootie and then like some hair on top thats me so i went off to find myself some waist defining garments this is the part of what not to wear where i get to shop by myself except stacy doesnt come and help me at the end you could text her though stacy so now that weve established your shape we kind of know what we want to be looking for the easiest most universal way to create a waist is to find something like an easy dress like a fitandflare dress saf this is kind of interesting it definitely has like a little waist cinching action all right im gonna try this on i think this is like the right type of garment that stacy was recommending but i feel like the fit is just not perfect like the waistline is almost too high the sleeves are a little tight but i think with color and i were on the right track in terms of color recommendations overall stacy mostly agreed with brad and that she thought my skin was pretty neutral stacy you dont have a lot of yellow undertone in your skin you dont have a lot of blue undertone in your skin easily i can see you in dark purple in burgundy in dark green this is interesting theres some shine theres some olive green or muted green there is a stitch at the waist i think now i dont think this one fits me quite right either first off my bra is just like out and second off it doesnt really flair on the bottom it clings more which is not ideal but i do kind of like the color and the beads it actually ended up being pretty tough to find a fitandflare dress that fit all of our specs so besides fitandflare dresses stacy had also mentioned that we could do like a widelegged pant when you do a really skinny jean as opposed to something a little bit wider you wind up creating the visual effects that we see this more than we see your whole leg right we want something that creates a longer line so we went on the hunt or widelegged pant listen i havent found it yet but i smell it ryan youre like a really good shopping shark ohthats good as a final note stacy wanted to emphasize that things would look different with my new hair especially color wise stacy its not that your coloring dictates what colors you can wear but you are going to find that you pop more in certain neutrals and pop more in certain colors based on the fact that you have a new hair color   saf this is true i have not explored anything really ive only really come to your house with this new hair color so well you came to the right place so after exploring a few stores i found something pant like that i thought fit all of the guidelines all right so this isnt a dress but it does have a waist cincher mechanism and it has these pant legs that are the same width all the way down and its green its a little bit of a pattern so im gonna try it on and see if it could be the one alright so this is my green stripe jumpsuit i dont think i was expecting to like the stripes but i think i do and i do like this sort of like muted but not too dark green color it is not a dress and its not really a fitandflare but the top is definitely fitted and then the pant legs are like straight down and not tapered at the ends so its hitting a lot of good stuff im gonna text a pic of this to stacy and see what she thinks alright
so it looks like stacy likes this jumpsuit and she says wider leg and vertical line print makes you look like a tall glass of water love the focus on the waist so lets get this guy and then get some accessories to finish it off stacy also recommended that we pick up some gold jewelry to go with my she wouldnt call it autumn but autumn complexion and she also suggested some flat or wedge sandals so with the outfit purchased it was time for the final touch of our perfect makeover the makeup so for the makeup portion we decided to use the information we had gathered from stacy and brad and combine it with some research to customize a look around my features i read a lot of articles for this you guys im prepared so i think like the first feature well be focusing on is the eyes so im gonna do my eyebrows really quick and then we can talk about how we are gonna flatter my eyes with eye shadow so there are two elements to consider here one is my eye shape and the other is my eye color after looking at a bunch of photos ive concluded that i have mildly protruding eyes i deduced this by looking at all of the possible i shaped listed and then eliminating the other ones but they also harp on the fact that protruding eyes have a lot of lid space which i do and the tips to flatter that type of eye shape are basically just like you can put a lot of stuff on your eyelid so i could have like a very large amount of eyeliner i can do some dark eye shadow i could do a smoky eye i could just really layer it on thick because i think the idea of doing your eye shadow according to your eye shape is to correct whatever shape you have into more of like a neutral almond eye besides that i have dark brown eyes and there are a few different eyes shadow colors that compliment brown eyes it seems like either you can go with like bold shocks of color like cobalt blue or purple or you can do something a little gold ear like gold copper and green so because the jumpsuit that we have is green i think im gonna stay in the like gold with a bit of greenish gold family and hopefully thatll flatter my eyes and my outfit alright so since the instructions were basically go ham i shall go ham i cant tell if i feel more complimented but im definitely feeling more dramatic im also gonna be using this green color from the pirates of the caribbean palette which we bought for a video and never made all right so this is a couple of eyeshadow colors on there but considering that i have protruding eyes i shall go in for one more darker color they said go ham ill give them a roast this is a luau over here hahaha so im gonna blend this out really quick and then just slap on some foundation and concealer and then well move on to the blush and lipstick which is very contingent on my skins undertones so well talk about those so once again both stacy and brad when looking at my skin said that i had overall neutral undertones but when i went to get a third opinion at sephora by you know getting color i queued by their little face scanner they seemed to think i was neutral but slightly warm the color that they initially scanned was 2 y o7 meaning like 2 tones of yellow away from medium but after some swatching and testing we ended up settling on 1 y o7 so we tried a more neutral tone i think this looks better one of the tricky things about having a neutral skin tone is that with these makeup advice articles a lot of them will just tell you you can wear whatever you want but i think in the spirit of having a slightly lighter hair and stacy recommending me gold jewelry im gonna continue down that neutral but slightly warm path so im gonna bring in some peachy blush it seems like peachy blushes are both like somewhat universally flattering but also if you have like warmer tones you should kind of like stick with warm stuff is what im reading alright so as we can see i put a lot of that on im going to just blend this out a little bit more so i can sort of diffuse it and then well move on to the lips following the trajectory of the color iq and the blush we decided to continue down the slightly warm path usually for warm undertones they recommend orange based lipsticks like terra cottas or corals or peaches so i went for this brick color hello there to finish off the look i added some pretty thick eyeliner and a dash of dark green eyeshadow on the outer corner lower lash line alright so i think that is my full face of makeup based on my features all in all im pretty into this look i think that overall its not like crazy far off from what i do normally but i think that there are a couple of things that are different mainly the amount of eye shadow thats on my eyes and also like any sort of like lower lash situation so now that my makeup is done i think its time to put all three of the pieces of my perfect makeover together and see what i look like so this is my final headtotoe perfect makeover ryan no longer a rhubarb   saf now i am a two radishes on top of each other ryan there you go ryan there you go   saf this look definitely includes some elements that i do currently wear but there are also some things that are more new to me in particular the color palette from top to bottom is much warmer than i usually go i think in general this is more of just like a summer sofia look i used to be a comfortable vampire now im a cinched garden gnome the shapes however i feel like ive at least dabbled in before ive had my hair this length before and despite the amount of like long sleeves sweatshirts i wear im not against cinching my waist listen ill give stacy that this is like a nice human body shape but sometimes i like to dress up like a bat so maybe well do half the time hourglass and you know the other half of the time just flying squirrel in terms of what things from this makeover ill incorporate going forward im not sure if ill really stick with the warmer color palette but i could definitely see myself keeping my hair short putting on some more eyeshadow when i get the chance and also embracing wide legged pants you look very comfortable i am very comfortable regardless of body shape thats one thing about wide leg pants i feel a little bit more like pajamas than skinny pants youre so damn lucky you wear gym shorts every day what so all in all in terms of this being my perfect makeover i do think that it complements my physical features and gets them a bit closer to being ideal and it was a fun experiment overall theres obviously the question of why these ideals or rules even exist and i think to touch on it briefly theyre related to instinctual preferences based on perceived fertility geometry and also just like societal constructs but i think thats all a bit much to unpack in this video so for now i think we can just take them at face value and see them as more of a jumping off point for style or color recommendations and not the endall beall of what you should wear or even what not to wear right stacy thank you guys so much for watching and a big thank you to brad and stacy for participating in this video also if you guys want to see more of this makeover process

smash that like button and if you want to see more videos like this make sure to shamash that subscribe button a big shout out to megan for watching thanks for watching megan and i will see you guys next time this is safiyas new intro song hello friends and welcome to another video today im gonna be buying a weeks worth of clothing from fashion nova now fashion nova is a trendy online clothing retailer that i see freaking everywhere and i guess that makes sense because they really go ham with the marketing you may recognize their name from the hashtag novababes which surprised me by not being a hashtag about ladies who attend villanova university unlike other online retailers like wish and romwe fashion novas prices are not suspiciously low but like those other online retailers a lot of the mystique around fashion nova exists because its not clear if the clothes are as good in real life as they are in the photos and a lot of the posts about fashion nova seem to be sponsored or partnered content so its hard to find an unbiased review so today im gonna be diving headfirst into the fashion nova cove cave grotto and buying a weeks worth of outfits in my quest to become a villanova babe all right lets start shopping okay so im gonna open up fashionnovacom and im also gonna open up a fashion novas instagram what fashion nova does on their instagram is that they have like their own posts that are like their sort of online catalogue models but they will also repost their nova babes wearing their fashion nova clothing so i basically wanno go through and like find novababe posts and then try and recreate their outfits and see how they look on me a not nova babe all right yes here are some dresses some body suits oh look theres a nova babe with her novabae oh you know what i said novabae as a joke but actually that is a hashtag in this caption oh wow this looks like a very distressed pair of jeans that is specifically distressed on the butt cheek ive actually never seen that before but you know ive worn my fair share of strange denim so i feel like you know maybe we could go for this i could wear some boy shorts maybe borrow some briefs from tyler and we could sort of do like a peekaboo situation so im gonna go to the fashion nova site and then search this term the truth about it denim bermudas all right so lets see what size i could be in these based on this size chart im gonna guess im a size 9 all right so let me add these to the cart and then let me see what shes wearing on her top again uh its called the meshing u cami like shes mishing you but shes meshing you it looks like a pretty standard gold tank top so why dont we just get a medium on top and that will conclude this outfit oh look at this its a nova babe with her nova babies oh is this adrienne bailon of the cheetah girls why it is and she is wearing the trench me up jacket as a dress well im surprised that adriennes cheating on the cheetah girls with the nova babes obviously adrienne has done many things since being on the cheetah girls including date rob kardashian but to me she will always be a cheetah sister adrien like has styled this with nothing underneath but on the website theyve styled it with a skirt underneath so well see when it gets here if we need to put something under this alright so i dont think i can find the exact overtheknee boots that she has on in the photo on fashionnovacom but i did find a couple of pairs that kind of have like some texture to them that could be a good dupe so im gonna go with these francines satin over the knee boots and that is outfit number two all right so lets see whats up next oh i like this this is like a black jumpsuit with slits up the legs and like red and white piping it looks like shes at a mall too and i love malls im a big fan of like maxi dresses and jumpsuits and i like that this one it has kind of like baggy legs so its not like super clinging to the thighs all right so im gonna add this rooftop bar jumpsuit in medium to the bag and that is pretty much all we need for our third outfit lets see what we should get next ooh this looks interesting this to me is like definitely like a modernday bratz outfit i think that the beret on top really seals its fate there alright so heres the top on the website it looks quite short it seems to hit sort of like directly under the boob so i guess you guys are all going to get view of my taylor swift midriff and then uh what were the pants called the carly bella striped pants well at least these pants look like theyre quite highrise im gonna get these in a size large and then add that to the bag all right so the last part of this outfit was the beret oh well i just searched for beret and i got a butt lifter so tyler in the background yeah ya did i might have to get a beret somewhere else all right so with those added to the cart that is outfit number four all right so whats next you know what this dress is really popular on their instagram like ive seen a few different posts that feature this mura mesh dress so i feel like if theyre continually marketing and showing people in this dress we should try it out this dress is definitely sort of that tight around the curves club dress that i think is like a signature of fashion nova it seems to be a ruched look so you can kind of like cup and skim im doing this i dont know what this is i think we should get this in a medium all right so that is outfit number 5 2 left oh my word what is that they say this is the shaina houndstooth velvet lounge set and it seems to be sort of like halfway in between like a houndstooth suit and like a juicy couture sweat suit so i think we should do it online the sweat suit seems like much looser but well see how it actually fits in person i did also find a pair of sunglasses that look like the one shes wearing so lets get those too so that is outfit number 6 all right so lets look for our last fashion nova outfit oh this is cute this looks like its like a mustard crop top that says  baby across the boobs and you know what im a  baby so why not advertise that above my chesticles all right i feel like as always we should go for a medium with this and im gonna add that to the bag so the next part of this outfit is the pencil skirt so lets see if they have a plaid pencil skirt all right so i feel like the closest dupe i could find on the site is this couldnt be bothered skirt and it looks to be about the right length but its just plain black instead of having that like dark grey plaid pattern shes also wearing these like silver these which i believe are also fashion nova and they do have a size  available and i think that will complete our outfit number seven all right so that is a weeks worth of outfits hopefully so im going to choose one business day shipping which has a pretty hefty price tag but if it actually gets here in one day i think its worth it okay so my order is confirmed so hopefully theyll get here pretty soon and once it does well start wearing it and see if i can ever truly become a nova babe okay so its a few days later and i think we have almost everything that we order from fashion nova even though we paid for like overnight shipping it came in like five days in fact fashion nova sent me an email like when it should have been here being like congrats were still working on it so as i said we have almost everythingthe sunglasses unfortunately never arrived they were on like the packing list of the items that should be here when we originally got the package but they were nowhere to be found but sunglasses aside i have all of my things here and well start wearing them now so for my first outfit i went for adrienne by lons trench me up jacket and b francine satin over the knee boots the cheetah sisters we stand together to finish off the styling of this outfit i put my hair up in a topknot and then i also added a little booty short i think adrienne might be a bit shorter than i am so this fit her more like a dress and for me well i guess its still a dress but its a dress that shows my underwear so adrienne instagrammed this outfit at some type of park in front of a fountain so we went to a park and found a fountain i wonder how adrienne got on in her stiletto boots because mine are sinking into the ground im just like you know sort of aerating the grass the jacket does look reasonably like the photo but it is much less flattering on me than it is on adrienne it is a little smaller than i expected i think i could have done with a large at least on bottom but then who knows what would have happened up top and the shoes even though they were the right size quickly became pretty painful i ended up having to walk in sort of like small waddling steps tyler why is the resemblance uncanny i think my gaiter resembles his so closely he thinks im just a giant goose tyler yeah hes like youre a little awkward but safiya i dont think i would wear this outfit again maybe i would try to wear this jacket over something but altogether this outfit made for a very precarious day tyler its surprisingly long i think was the goose chase that really got you over the edge safiya it was truly a wild goose chase so for my second outfit i went for my early favorite from when we were shopping which was the rooftop bar jumpsuit skys out thighs out thats what i always say in the instagram this nova babe is basically just posing at a mall so we went to the mall and posed its kind of like as if each of my individual legs are superheroes with capes to which i say no capes i do think that this jumpsuit does look a lot like the photos online at least while youre stationary but once you start walking youre confronted with the reality of the slits the thing is im okay with my thighs being out its really just like right here that kind of makes me nervous cause i just feel like it could just flap inwards and then youd really just see my pubes i do actually like the look of this jumpsuit when youre standing still but in motion things move around things ride up and it just feels kind of risky its basically a fancy loincloth tyler yeah i would wear this again but maybe like on vacation or to like a pool party i dont think i would wear it out in public again just because of the pube anxiety tyler its not skys out thighs out tyler its uh loins out groins out tyler is that thats the same thing so one day three i went for the truth about it denim bermudez and the meshing you cami tyler whoever made these jeans are like i want the whole ass out safiya each buttock must be exposed to its maximum capacity i had already planned on wearing like little booty shorts underneath these jeans but i wasnt expecting how seethrough the top would be so i also put on a little camisole underneath just to keep myself monetized ive done enough under layers that im not nervous about being exposed personally but like the amount of rips and dips is interesting tyler it looks like a bear tried to grab your butt yeah i got groped by wolverine dammit hugh i think ive experienced my fair share of strange denim at this point and this definitely isnt the weirdest pair of jeans ive ever worn but the behind is really confounding ohoh tyler what safiya i can feel the hot chair through my path theres something about these that are so absurd that i almost want to wear them again but i dont know how or why besides of course the like extreme distressing on the buttock theyre also like a capri or bermuda short length which is a length of pant that i have not worn since about  or 7 and to be honest bermuda shorts are pretty much the last item of clothing i would expect to be sexyfied but maybe i just dont have that nova babe vision so for our fourth outfit i went for the maura mesh dress i just think this dress is kind of sexy i do feel kind of like the inside of a nice casket in this instagram this nova babe is posing inside while holding a bouquet of roses and im just going to pose in front of the thermostat id say this dress does look like it did in the photos but it fits much stranger than i thought it would in particular it was weirdly tight around the upper arms everything else about the dress has some give but right here its hurting already as a result i had extremely limited range of motion i do kind of feel like i could hulk out of this dress groaning hulklike noises i kind of heard little rip and while we were eating dinner i had to sneakily take my arms out of the sleeves in order to be able to like move my arms around the table i wish i could say i liked this dress i think that if you werent planning on wearing it for a very long amount of time you could definitely get away with it but in terms of like an actual dress to wear i dont like it so for my fifth outfit i went for the carlibela striped pants and the mixed business tank top tyler you look so much like a bratz doll its crazy safiya i am sophie the french exchange student the insponova babe was wearing like an acidwashed denim jacket a beret and very pointy nude heels which we did add to the outfit but none of which are from fashion nova my feet were just not made for heels in any way shape or form and i think that is gonna be one of my bigger barriers in my quest to become a villanova babe i liked the top i thought it was totally fine the pants however are much more chiffony than i expected and they also have a weird pair of shorts inside of them that makes them pretty uncomfortable besides that i think that the styling of this outfit was fun but it was sort of cumbersome tyler you look at youre balancing a plate on your head safiya how do i beret how does one beret i like the idea of this outfit but i think that i would have to find a different pair of burgundy colored pants because the current ones have just rode all the way up tyler no taylor swift midriff to be found tyler where are you navel safiya singing where are you now that i navel safyia making music noises thats justin bieber so for my sixth outfit i went for this  baby crop top this couldnt be bothered skirt and these olympic booties  is the best in general i think that all of these items ended up looking like how i thought they would so im impressed by the internet too irl translation and im also impressed by like how comfortable i am i do have like full range of motion of my arms tyler yeah safiya and like a decent range of motion down here and surprisingly of all the fashion nova shoes are actually pretty comfortable the only thing i didnt like about the shoes is that it looks like after one wear i have like a crease in the toe but theyre comfortable its just a shame that they look like this now i would wear this outfit again maybe not all together but i liked the skirt i liked the shoes and i liked the shirt something about this skirt reminds me of like joan from mad men who is arguably like a  nova babe amongst all of my internet hauls this is the rare outfit thats three for three you know im saying to the world what my parents had sex  years ago well more like  and a half years  so for my last outfit i went for this sheyna houndstooth velvet lounge set i kind of feel like a villain from like american hustle or something tyler or like the hangover safiya i think in person the jumpsuit ended up fitting more like it did on the model on the website than it did on the nova babe on instagram i will say that the jumpsuit is quite comfortable and the medium seems to be fitting me pretty well but to wear it like the instagram model i really have to like open it up pretty far and like really make it kind of uncomfortable in this instagram the nova babe is posing on an ottoman and taking a photo of herself in the mirror we dont have any mirrors like that in our house so we went to ikea can we get some meatballs tyler yes safiya im down i had a good time walking around ikea and lounging in the pretend bedrooms tyler you look like you could be sitting right next like dj khalid safiya another one another one another one what else does he say and thankfully they did have a mirror we could use it was honestly sort of hard to replicate her pose she kind of juts out her butt in the immortal words of tyra banks this jumpsuit is really far away from my own personal style but i did kind of like it honestly if there were a particular occasion or costume party of some kind that i could wear this to i definitely would i can eat as much lingonberry as i want fake laughter all right so that was my week wearing fashion nova outfits i think that comfort wise my favorite outfit was the  baby outfit but aesthetically i also really liked the black jumpsuit that showed off my full thigh overall my biggest takeaway about fashion nova in general is that most of the outfits do photograph well but a lot of them run into problems when you start walking whether they flap open or have strange linings on the inside or just restrict your arms within  degrees of motion for some reason so although i do appreciate that the clothes look pretty similar to how theyre pictured online a lot of them dont feel so good i guess that leaves us with one final question am i a nova babe and i think the answer is that im lacking some posing skills and tolerance for foot pain but if i could be carried to a location instagram and then carried out of that location maybe i could be thank you guys so much for watching if you liked that video make sure to shamash that like button and if you want

out my nextbeat i vlog on there every sunday a big shoutout to derp for watching thanks for watching derp and i will see you guys a next time hello friends and welcome to another video today were gonna be testing out questionable beauty hacks from instagram videos now weve previously tested out some strange hacks from facebook videos with mediocre success and since then pretty much all ive been seeing on my instagram explore page are similar beauty hack videos they seem to think that im a hacker that i like hacks or that i am a hack so ive decided to take these referrals as a sign that i should dive back in and put these videos to the test instagram has a lot of beauty videos in general which are often speckled or arranged into playlists on the explore page or free booted from individual creators and reposted by big make up accounts and by design you can churn through like dozens of these videos at a time i mean look at those thumbnails dont you want to click on those is that james charles almost all of these videos are sped up have little to no talking and oh yeah instagram also doesnt have a progress bar so you cant skip around or rewind in addition i find that instagram videos are more prone to true clickbaiting than facebook videos youll get some classic thumbnails like this one with a giant red vampire eye but then when you click into the video its just a normal eye shadow tutorial but some of these videos are just click baity in that they use a ridiculous seeming method in order to get an enticing thumbnail whether or not that method helps you do anything faster or better or anything at all and those are the videos were gonna be mostly focusing on today as much as i would like to try out permanent retina damage alright so lets dive right into these the first hack is certainly beauty related but its not for your face it is in fact for the pits thats right your armpits thats what i mean its an armpit beauty hack alright so this video was reposted by makeup vines but its originally by sarah revolta the comments are pretty harsh there are a lot of like nauseous green emojis and um one girl says tbh i threw up so basically what happens is sarah wakes up and oh no she has armpits she doesnt want you to see them so shes gonna cover them with honey oats and baking soda i think actually the premise is that she has like dark skin on her underarms or something because she certainly doesnt have any hair interestingly enough diy armpit lightening masks are kind of a motif throughout a lot of instagram hack videos i feel like its kind of like bleaching your bhole its like a little unnecessary but if you really want to i guess you can so she puts her diy mixture like on her armpits and then she sits with it for a while to let it do its good stuff she doesnt say how long you should leave it on for oh all right so maybe she means ten minutes because as shes leaning back she just goes ten but after some amount of time she scoops the oatmeal off and feeds it to her boyfriend i am so happy and yet also sad for tyler that that occurred because now he has to eat my armpit oatmeal tyler what you showered today right safiya yes i shower every day not convincing smile and i smell very good always tyler thats a lie safiya all right the first thing she does is honey and it doesnt look like she has like very specific proportions she just kind of has like a big old spoon and just puts in a big old spoon as for the oats she kind of does like one heaping tablespoon so im gonna do like a couple of these there we go and for the baking soda she kind of just does like a little less all right so her next step is that she mixes it together and right off the bat its pretty dry i think i might need a little more honey how am i so bad at this i will say she just seems like she just sort of did a couple of swipes and then it was like a nice sort of wet mixture all right ready for the application tyler ah thats nasty dude safiya is this what im supposed to do tyler this feels like the worst like sexy roleplaying thing ever safiya its like a cosmo tip its like spice it up by bringing food into the bedroom oh its honey and baking soda in your pits i will say it smells kind of good though all right im like a little bit unsure of how to do this with my other arm pit full of oatmeal already oh i need help i cant do this with my left hand tyler it really doesnt spread does it safiya oh no spread it down no no down not out ill hold the camera oh no tyler oh st oh god i just dropped a huge chunk safiya no no not out ty up and down clearly tyler i think we have different definitions of armpit here safiya alright here we go after some struggle both my armpits are oated my arms are gonna get tired okay so its been about  minutes since i put on the right armpits oatmeal and the oatmeal has definitely warmed up in fact its turned kind of like whitish and creamy almost as if its cooked or perhaps like reacted somehow with the baking soda she basically just like scrapes it off with the spoon and then immediately tricks her boyfriend into eating it alright ty are you ready i got a spoonful of oatmeal for you tyler why am i doing this safiya oh thats not food is it these are really that bad ew you just drooled all over me tyler very salty safiya its salty thats my sweat tyler disgusted noises alright so after wiping off our oatmeal mask completely im not sure that my armpits are any lighter it kind of feels like maybe they were just exfoliated a little nicely i did really have to kind of scrub those oats off and taking a look at her after armpits they look pretty much the same but in terms of the execution of this hack i just got oats all over this floor and my shirt and i might have poisoned tyler so i think that you know you could probably just use like a body scrub on your armpits and save yourself a lot of mess alright so for our second hack were gonna go in for another lightining treatment except this time instead of being for your underarms its for your under eyes so this is a video by medina shrien zada she basically sort of pops up and she has like very exaggerated dark circles they look pretty fake like maybe she just put like a lot of eyeshadow underneath her eye and then shes skins and cuts up a potato puts some honey and black pepper on the slices and puts them under her eye for five minutes and then when she lifts them off of her eyes the dark circles are gone as well as the eye shadow now it does say further down into her caption that shes mimicked dark circles but its pretty far down and i think people in the comments arent really having it so with that lets try it this is coincidentally a great time to try and test this hack because i was up till 6 am last night and i have a whole undereye suitcase situation going on okay so the first step is to peel the potato tyler do you know how to peel a potato safiya no im not very good at this can i just slice off the peel this is much better i got it to be sort of like a geometric gemstone by just peeling it with a knife alright so basically she just sort of cuts off like little sections that would cover her under eye area and then next she just puts a little bit of honey on em and then she goes like this so then the next thing she does is she just sprinkles some black pepper on and then applies it to her eyes cheers okay this isnt so bad i will say that right off the bat the potatoes kind of cold so im feeling some refreshment so thats probably actually good for your under eye circles move over a cucumber slice potato is coming for your wig im not feeling any sneeziness or eye pain because of the pepper as of yet the pepper is more just like texture its like i feel like a piece wedged in between the potato and me alright so in five minutes lets take these bad boys off and see if my undereye circles have packed their bags and left are you ready for my princess diaries reveal tyler well you dont have a unibrow so safiya i do have a unibrow i just plucked it tada oh i look like i was just crying coffee grounds oh actually now that ive lifted the potato up im actually feeling the tingling from the black pepper and like almost a little spice oh oh its hot oh this is odd i feel like i have like a bengay patch underneath my eyes you and i mean like a salone puss i think that maybe some of the logic behind this hack is that the pepper will like stimulate blood flow but my undereyes just kind of hurt and i dont think they look much better now she said this was her under eye routine so maybe like one time isnt enough but that is a lot of work and pain for a maybe so ive put on some foundation because the next hack is a makeup hack so this account dramatized free booted and reposted this video from promisetamang they gave her some credit but you definitely had to click read more to see it so the thing that stuck out to me about this hack is that its basically like a surprise double hack from the thumbnail it looks like shes using tweezers to somehow contour her nose and when you click in shes actually using the tweezers to draw in her eyebrows after he completely does her eyebrows at the very end she does her nose kind of quickly so it was kind of like an emotional rollercoaster i thought i had been click baited and then right at the end i was saved all right so i think what she does is she just like takes the eyebrow gel and like paints the ends of her tweezer with it she has thinner eyebrows than i do so i worry that my eyebrows may not be contained by these tweezers as she gets to the back she closes the tweezer did that do anything i feel like i just got a little bit of eyebrow gel in the head of my brow right here i do have slightly wider tweezers that maybe would work better so lets try those that didnt do much im gonna try more of a pomade than a gel just to you know give it more of an impact oh thats darker thats better and then narrow it narrow it oh i skid marked all right let me try the other side and then well try and fill them in oh no oh no left hand no good the thing is its not decidedly worse than the other one but neither are really great tyler you look like an angry bird right now safiya i feel like an angry bird right now i feel like im getting the intent of the hack but my artistic abilities are not really up to snuff so lets try out the nose contour maybe ill be better at that since theres less like drawing involved all right ready humming tyler oh thats a good draw right there i dont think i did that well with this one either i think that this hack easily goes skidmark it takes the skidmark exit nearly every time i dont know what kind of brush shes using so im just gonna use this brush and just try and buff it out buff it out what wha what what buff it out i will admit that i dont do nose contouring very often this side looks okay and then you go over to this side and its just sad now though compared to my nose contour my eyebrows are looking great so im happy about that at least i think if you have the right features that fit inside of like a normal sized tweezer maybe this might actually work for you but besides that i do think its a little more trouble than its worth okay so the next hack is another makeup hack and i actually recognize the company thats made it its cristines favorite channel troom troom cristine singing gotta get those troom troom views yes so this video was reposted by diy amazing diy but i think something got lost in translation because the video doesnt really make a lot of sense early on in the video they introduced the hack which is like using a spoon over your eye to like create like an eye shadow look and then they sort of like put clip in extensions in their hair apply some eyeliner and then are like told by a third person to only use one hand and then by the end of the video theyve given up on doing their makeup entirely none of that is explained or captioned its just if you keep watching the video after the hack youll notice that theres a lot more video and it doesnt make any sense okay and with that lets try it alright im just gonna put like a little bit of a base shade on i dont really know what else this girl does she just kind of puts a spoon on her eye and then goes to town though to be fair she kind of does like this sort of crease action and then moves on to do something offcamera and when she comes back her eye shadow looks a lot better so theres definitely some movie magic involved alright ive got a couple different spoons i think im gonna go with this one because its flatter and then im gonna take a little bit of this brick color and go in oh thats moving my contact around i can feel that but this is hard to do with one eye tyler oh thats gonna be a good cut crease safiya first doesnt end up being a cut crease it just sort of ends up being like a dramatic crease look okay my contacts back tada i think that over here we are seeing something that could be like an eye shadow look but in general its not very symmetric or even let me try the other spoon on the other eye i think this ones a little more rounded so hopefully itll be a little more flush to my eyeball tyler alright you know what that looks pretty good safiya the thing is for a starting point for eye shadow like you could start from here and then just like keep blending it out im just not sure that using a spoon is easier than just like putting the product straight onto your eye just to be fair to troom troom im gonna blend this out a little bit you know just to make it like more of a look in general this video just confuses me i think its almost like a game of like bad beauty hack telephone but that seems to be a big part of instagram videos in general a lot of them are stolen and chopped up i guess that might contribute to why theyre so confusing originally i had suspected that this was multiple troom troom videos cut together but amazingly all of the footage is actually just from one video called makeup challenge full face using food and school supplies i guess these werent meant to be hacks after all okay so this last hack is a hair hack that im very excited about so this video was posted by a page called makeup vines but it was free booted from fiveminute crafts so basically what it is you put a scrunchie on like the nozzle of a vacuum cleaner and then you vacuum up your hair put the scrunchie on and voila ponytail this hack in particular i remember seeing in like a viral video from a few years ago about like a disgruntled dad trying to do his daughters hair so tyler will have the honour of vacuuming my head todaytyler so basically its me testing this hack safiya yes but its my head on the line tyler without further ado turns on vaccuum safiya ah tyler lets vacuum some hair are you ready for an instant ponytail safiya yelling no tyler it keeps getting your shirt safiya screaming safiya did it work tyler vacuum shuts off is that what they want us to do safiya you know that tickled the sound was absolutely terrifying but the sensation was quite nice try it again tyler so im gonna double it up this time because i think it was a little loose hey that wasnt so bad safiya i have a complete chunk of hair thats missing but thats artful i guess tyler you look like a spunky like zoo disney character right now let me try it one more time its still a little messy ah youve got so much hair oh here we go here we go here we go thats what im talking about and thats a ponytail its not perfect but its close the level of perfection from fiveminute crafts is pretty mindblowing because theres like stray hairs everywhere safiya its not so bad im surprised that it worked even as well as it did a major con to this though is that the inside of a vacuum sees some stuff and you probably dont want that stuff on your head besides that im not sure its faster than just doing a normal ponytail yourself but its definitely more exciting so viral video yes hack that you recommend to people i dont think so this could be kind of a good prank though hey let me help you but like give you a slightly messy ponytail okay so those were my questionable instagram hacks im not sure i really got the hang of any of these hacks but i think the one that was the closest to a hack that might actually work was the tweezer one the other ones may have had some effect but i dont think the results were worth the trouble pain or mess so i wouldnt consider them better than traditional methods i think my main takeaway from this is that the reason why instagram has so many hacks like these which are so ridiculous in nature is that the video posters or reposters are working within the confines of instagram where you only really get a thumbnail to work with there arent any visible video titles on instagram and you can only see the caption after youve clicked it so you kind of have to make a video that will lend itself to having a crazy thumbnail and if you dont well then you just have to make up a thumbnail to be fair these videos can be pretty entertaining so if they were marketed more as things you should watch rather than things you should do theyd be a lot less perplexing i would just also say to instagram please add a progress bar and to you all at home maybe dont put black pepper under your eyes thank you guys so much for watching if you like that video make sure to smash that like button and if you want to see more videos like this make sure to smash that subscribe

will see you guys next time ♩♫♩♫♪ hello friends and welcome to another video this week were gonna be taking on another questionable clothing item platform crocs yes i said platform and yes i said crocs i said aplatform crocs we were first made aware of this item in october of last year when balenciaga sent them down the runway for their spring and summer  collection and needless to say many a headline writer was shook balenciaga is trolling us all with these nch platform crocs these platform crocs from balenciaga will tear your feelings apart lets stop pretending balenciagas meme bait is cool regardless of how you feel about crocs i dont think anyone foresaw them in an  platform version sashaying down a runway but it happened now at first they werent available because they were supposed to come out in spring of this year and then when they came out for preorder they sold out almost instantaneously but after months of waiting theyre finally here and its time to try them on and see if they are ridiculous or fashionable or my guess ridiculously fashionable all right lets bring them out oh wow theyre a lot heavier than i thought they would be oh my god im so confused all right so it looks like ive got a letter this is my receipt dont want to look at that
 and here are the crocs tadaaaa  
safiya actually theyre sort of smaller than i would have thought online these seemed like very very very large but this seems like a sort of classic spicegirllevel platform so these are definitely heavier than like normal crocs which are quite light there are a lot of cute little charms on here what are they called widgets  safiya jibbitz it looks like theyre kind of going for like a jetsetterlike passport theme weve got like paris berlin  and then on this other shoe weve got a peace sign a pug and an avocado they definitely like make a statement they look like a piece of bubble gum has not been stuck to your shoe but has eaten your shoe they seem sort of difficult to style or to like wear things with so this week will be an interesting challenge  did i make you phlegm a little bit oh wow yes i am very tall in these and in fact like i think that if these were any taller i would die so i dont know what i was thinking my first impressions on how easy these things are to wear is that uh theyre not they feel comfortable on my feet but when i pick up my foot to try and walk i feel like bride of frankenstein im just worried about falling off of them like timberrrrr and thats how regina george died that would be how i die well i think we should begin our journey we should walk at least a mile cumulatively over the next week in these shoes thats not that far so on day one i wanted to style my platform crocs the same way that balenciaga styled them on the runway so i wore like a black maxi dress with a white longsleeved shirt underneath plain makeup and large earrings  now im not gonna speak for balenciaga and heaven knows they wouldnt want me to but i kind of felt like a kid playing dressup in this outfit my sleeves are long my dress is long my shoes are giant you know like when you have your moms high heels on youre like  almost like an angelica from rugrats moment which i feel like sort of capitalizes on the youthful feel of crocs isnt fashion obsessed with youth why not go for that sixyearold chic  so i decided that i should take the crocs home to the balenciaga store in beverly hills if im not fancy now i never will be  a place that i had never been before but these shoes certainly had i will say that the crocs were not the only strange thing inside of that balenciaga store despite the price tag of these shoes im not sure that i really fit in with the whole beverly hills vibe its different than wearing like an  stiletto shoe its like this is an  croc clog so i was questionably fancy but unquestionably unstable i had to lean on tyler for support    and i barely made it over a speed bump in the parking lot so on day two i wanted to attempt to wear the crocs with an outfit that i would normally wear i feel like in general crocs are usually like a illjustgrabmycrocs type of shoe going out the door to an outdoor activity grocery shopping this is my onthego stance  i think that my stability while walking was slowly improving  i discovered that you can kind of like walk around on the tips of the crocs and that is somehow more stable its like a pointe shoe in ballet i feel more agile watch out im gonna get there eventually though i wouldnt say i was trying to blend in i would say my outfit was more on the muted side but i think the crocs were just upstaging everything else that was going on so i dont think that this like casual look really works you kind of have to like bring it up here to really match whats going on down there they were large and in charge and being in charge they decided to take me to the crocs store to show themselves off to the other crocs i think inside of the store they really did assert their dominance   but the styling of them most closely resembles the tiniest of crocs that are marketed to toddlers at the end of the day im not sure who really bested who because i did leave the store having bought many items  so for my third outfit i tried something a little different yesterdays outfit was like a little bit plain on top so i decided to try and up the ante a little bit on the upper body i went for more of like a raver look though im not sure you would really want to wear this to a rave or if you did you might want to be stationary because any sort of like hopping or dancing might cause you to topple i think one thing i underestimated about this outfit was how high and exposed my booty would be or like close to being exposed i think that in some ways this outfit was more balanced like it felt less like the shoes were in charge but i think that i was more eyecatching in general so more people kind of like did a doubletake and then looked down and were like oh those im a rebel  if i were ever to get a ticket it would be in this outfit  you are sixanda half feet tall and you are breaking the law so after getting a chance to style these shoes i was kind of starting to like them but clearly a lot of people online did not so im actually gonna instagram a photo of this look and see what you guys think cause obviously like headline writers were shook but i wonder how yall as individuals feel i would say that your guyss comments kind of fall into three categories the first which is upset the second category being confused and conflicted and then the third category which is beyond liking them and in fact planning to wear them in important situations though i do sort of doubt you guys are actually gonna go out and buy these i think that a majority of the comments were actually positive or at least like surprisingly okay with them so maybe some of those articles were just being shooketh for shookeths sake oh my god look at my little toenail sticking out i didnt notice this so for my fourth outfit i wanted to go for kind of like a retro platform look so i went for this like late  early  vibe it was also very pink i think because the crocs were demanding some matching clothing  yes i am the shoe today nice to meet you my name is balenciaga  never no so when i think of platform shoes the first thing that comes to mind is baby spice of the spice girls you can call me hairy spice when i think of crocs the first thing that springs into my mind is my brother gardening in  but there has to be more to it so i thought that diving into the history behind both of these shoes might shed some light on our current situation as for crocs the first pairs were produced for the  fort lauderdale boat show marketed as the perfect boating shoe from then on crocs had a serious moment in the  becoming the fastestgrowing shoe company in  thats not to say we thought they were fashionable back then i think it was more of a collective decision to say screw it these are comfortable and im going to wear them since then theyve remained a goto lightweight shoe that you can throw on to check your mail walk around your yard go to the grocery store but they havent as of yet broken through the style barrier unlike crocs platforms shoes have been in and out of style since pretty much  bc when greek actors used them in plays to make themselves more visible during the heian period in japan platform shoes originated as a way for rice farmers to avoid sinking into the mud but over time were adopted by geishas and oiran as a way to both stop their kimonos from dragging on the ground but also as a way to signal their status wealth and profession the thing is my skirt is very short so i dont need help like keeping my clothes off of the ground but i am in fact elevating my outfit for all to see  theyve come to take my crocs away with an ax across the world in medieval europe platform shoes were also prevalent mostly amongst fancy folk who used them both to tower above commoners and also to avoid sinking into the mud and literal poop on the streets i dont think balenciaga meant this but like the original use case of platforms and the original use case of crocs are somewhat similar like theyre both used to like wade through mud so putting them both into one shoe kind of makes more sense than i originally thought in more recent history platforms came back into style in the  during the great depression as the cork used for their soles was cheaper than traditional materials and from then on they were popular with actresses in the  glam rockers in the  and an interesting combination of the spice girls and goth and punk subcultures in the  as for this outfit i did enjoy the  vibes but i think all the pink was a bit much for me i think im gonna need to watch a horror movie after this outfit or at least like marathon the addams family so after learning some history and doing some styling i wanted to put these shoes through some practicality tests so were gonna head down to disneyland tonight and wear these around all evening and see what happens and if i break an ankle i think i am getting better at walking around in these shoes though i think that also makes me cockier which makes me fall more  but after a few hours of being on my feet i think the main hindrance was the exhaustion onwards ever onwards on the inexorable march towards death i think theres just more effort required when wearing this type of platform thats not really like strapped to your feet the way like a sneaker is so eventually my feet needed to be stretched out every few minutes or so and though i wasnt getting like blisters i was actually hurting a little bit thats how my calves feel when they get a good stretch besides that i did enjoy being very tall at disneyland no one told me i was too tall for any of the rides and i was just heighty enough to touch the magic castle did you see i could touch the portcullis  so on day six i wanted to take my platform crocs to the water so although i personally say crocs do well in like muddy situations tyler insists that one wears crocs to the beach what i did not expect was how hard it would be to get to the water wait take this i cannot stand up straight for the life of me my crocs are sinking into the sand since walking slowly wasnt getting me anywhere i decided to make a mad dash for it it was not working  im totally fine you said it would be good on the beach once we got to the harder sand though things started looking up but now lets see what the ocean does waah  waaaah  wah wah wah wah i started lifting my foot up while there was water underneath me and my foot started floating away  because theres like a giant flotation device attached to it so since tyler had made us come to the beach i made him try on the crocs oh be careful ty dont bait him maybe tyler does have better balance than me  or maybe not and he was right that the crocs can be easily rinsed off but with the unevenness of the sand and the height of the platform i would not recommend wearing these shoes to the beach no so for our last outfit i wanted to go full wildandout headtotoe questionable fashion decisions  now that we have done quite a few of these videos i do have like a lot of ugly clothes to choose from so i chose a classic the band ruffle tshirt and also a neverbeforeseen item the hoodie sweatpants these pants are absolutely ridiculous  theyre almost almost outshining the shoes i bought them to make a video out of but we never did so here they are this is kind of like what i imagine clothing in the future will be weve got nowhere else to go but ugly whenever i wear a full outfit of socalled ugly items im always curious as to which one will be the worst and i dont think the crocs were the worst  even if the crocs were relatively tame the whole outfit did make me look kind of like an avantgarde killer clown i kind of feel dangerous like its  pm at target and im here to be honest im surprised they even let me in the store i feel like i could be a meme you know instead of the walmart yodeling boy i could be the target platform crocs girl i would accept that moniker  yeah no i dont know about these okay so that was my week of wearing platform crocs overall once the initial shock wore off the fashion of them wasnt too bad and i did actually get a fair amount of compliments in person i think that any of the pushback to the style of these shoes comes from that like stigma around crocs and not really from their actual appearance that said they are very impractical they are waterproof and made of foam but theyre not very comfortable to walk around in especially for like long amounts of time and theyre very easy to fall off of you also cant stylewise just like grab these shoes and go like i feel like you really have to plan your outfit ahead of time all in all in terms of the existence of these shoes im of two minds i enjoy how crazy and irreverent they are and i do like the idea that balenciaga is trolling people who might not like crocs by like making them fashion but i also dont love the idea of taking an accessible shoe that millions of people wear and love and turning it into a luxury item i feel like platform crocs should be marketed to people who like crocs not just people who can afford the crazy price tag and might be wearing them ironically not that anyone really needs these but it does seem like some people might want to wear them to their wedding to which ill say if you will actually get married in these and you are a size  womens i will send them to you thank you guys so much for watching and a quick update
